# MCP Protocol Fix Documentation

## Issue Overview

The MCP Memory Service was experiencing recurring errors related to the MCP protocol implementation. Specifically:

1. The server correctly responded to `resources/list` requests.
2. The server failed to handle `prompts/list` requests, returning: `{"code":-32601,"message":"Method not found"}`.
3. These errors repeated in a cycle approximately every 5 seconds.

## Fix Implementation

The fix involved implementing proper handling of the `prompts/list` method in the MCP server. According to the MCP protocol documentation, this method should be implemented even if a server doesn't provide any prompts.

### Changes Made

1. Added the `Prompt` type import to the imports section:
   ```python
   from mcp.types import Resource, Prompt
   ```

2. Added a handler for the `prompts/list` method in the `register_handlers` method of the `MemoryServer` class:
   ```python
   @self.server.list_prompts()
   async def handle_list_prompts() -> List[types.Prompt]:
       # Return an empty list of prompts
       # This is required by the MCP protocol even if we don't provide any prompts
       logger.debug("Handling prompts/list request")
       return []
   ```

### Expected Response

With this fix, the server now correctly responds to `prompts/list` requests with an empty list of prompts:
```json
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":[REQUEST_ID],"result":{"prompts":[]}}
```

## Verification

To verify that the fix is working correctly:

1. Start the MCP Memory Service using the installation instructions in `INSTALLATION.md`.
2. Monitor the logs for any "Method not found" errors.
3. The recurring errors related to `prompts/list` should no longer appear.

## Technical Background

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) defines several standard methods that servers should implement, even if they don't provide the corresponding functionality. This ensures that clients can reliably interact with any MCP server without encountering unexpected errors.

The `prompts/list` method is one such standard method. It allows clients to discover what prompts a server provides. Even if a server doesn't provide any prompts, it should still implement this method and return an empty list rather than a "Method not found" error.

## Integration with Memory Wrapper

The memory wrapper script (`memory_wrapper.py`) automatically uses the fixed version of the server implementation. No additional configuration is needed to benefit from this fix when using the wrapper.

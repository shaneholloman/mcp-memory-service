  - **Refactored**: Cloudflare config dictionary construction to use dictionary comprehension
  - **Improvement**: Separated configuration keys list from transformation logic
  - **Benefit**: Easier to maintain and modify configuration keys
  - **Code Quality**: More Pythonic, cleaner, and more readable
  - **Impact**: No functional changes, pure code quality improvement
  - **File Modified**: `scripts/sync/check_drift.py`
  - **Credit**: Implements Gemini code review suggestions from PR #224

## [8.25.1] - 2025-11-16

### Fixed
- **Drift Detection Script Initialization** - Corrected critical bugs in `check_drift.py` (PR #224)
  - **Bug 1**: Fixed incorrect config attribute `SQLITE_DB_PATH` → `SQLITE_VEC_PATH` in AppConfig
  - **Bug 2**: Added missing `cloudflare_config` parameter to HybridMemoryStorage initialization
  - **Impact**: Script was completely broken for Cloudflare/Hybrid backends - now initializes successfully
  - **Error prevented**: `AttributeError: 'AppConfig' object has no attribute 'SQLITE_DB_PATH'`
  - **File Modified**: `scripts/sync/check_drift.py`
  - **Severity**: High - Script was non-functional for users with hybrid or cloudflare backends
- **CI Test Infrastructure** - Added HuggingFace model caching to prevent network-related test failures (PR #225)
  - **Root Cause**: GitHub Actions runners cannot access huggingface.co during test runs
  - **Solution**: Implemented `actions/cache@v3` for `~/.cache/huggingface` directory
  - **Pre-download step**: Downloads `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` model after dependency installation
  - **Impact**: Fixes all future PR test failures caused by model download restrictions
  - **Cache Strategy**: Key includes `pyproject.toml` hash for dependency tracking
  - **Performance**: First run downloads model, subsequent runs use cache
  - **File Modified**: `.github/workflows/main.yml`

### Technical Details
- **PR #224**: Drift detection script now properly initializes Cloudflare backend with all required parameters (api_token, account_id, d1_database_id, vectorize_index)
- **PR #225**: CI environment now caches embedding models, eliminating network dependency during test execution
- **Testing**: Both fixes validated in PR test runs - drift detection now works, tests pass consistently

## [8.25.0] - 2025-11-15

### Added
- **Hybrid Backend Drift Detection** - Automatic metadata synchronization using `updated_at` timestamps (issue #202)
  - **Bidirectional awareness**: Detects metadata changes on either backend (SQLite-vec ↔ Cloudflare)
  - **Periodic drift checks**: Configurable interval via `MCP_HYBRID_DRIFT_CHECK_INTERVAL` (default: 1 hour)
  - **"Newer timestamp wins" conflict resolution**: Prevents data loss during metadata updates
  - **Dry-run support**: Preview changes via `python scripts/sync/check_drift.py`
  - **New configuration variables**:
    - `MCP_HYBRID_SYNC_UPDATES` - Enable metadata sync (default: true)
    - `MCP_HYBRID_DRIFT_CHECK_INTERVAL` - Seconds between drift checks (default: 3600)
    - `MCP_HYBRID_DRIFT_BATCH_SIZE` - Memories to check per scan (default: 100)
  - **New methods**:
    - `BackgroundSyncService._detect_and_sync_drift()` - Core drift detection logic with dry-run mode
    - `CloudflareStorage.get_memories_updated_since()` - Query memories by update timestamp
  - **Enhanced initial sync**: Now detects and syncs metadata drift for existing memories

### Fixed
- **Issue #202** - Hybrid backend now syncs metadata updates (tags, types, custom fields)
  - Previous behavior only detected missing memories, ignoring metadata changes
  - Prevented silent data loss when memories updated on one backend but not synced
  - Tag fixes in Cloudflare now properly propagate to local SQLite
  - Metadata updates no longer diverge between backends

### Changed
- Initial sync (`_perform_initial_sync`) now compares timestamps for existing memories
- Periodic sync includes drift detection checks at configurable intervals
- Sync statistics tracking expanded with drift detection metrics

### Technical Details
- **Files Modified**:
  - `src/mcp_memory_service/config.py` - Added 3 configuration variables
  - `src/mcp_memory_service/storage/hybrid.py` - Drift detection implementation (~150 lines)
  - `src/mcp_memory_service/storage/cloudflare.py` - Added `get_memories_updated_since()` method
  - `scripts/sync/check_drift.py` - New dry-run validation script
- **Architecture**: Timestamp-based drift detection with 1-second clock skew tolerance
- **Performance**: Non-blocking async operations, configurable batch sizes

- **Code Quality**: Regex-based sanitization more scalable, DOM element caching reduces redundant queries
- **Commit**: ffc6246 - refactor: code quality improvements from Gemini review (issue #180)

## [8.24.3] - 2025-11-15

### Fixed
- **GitHub Release Manager Agent** - Resolved systematic version history omission in README.md (commit ccf959a)
  - Fixed agent behavior that was omitting previous versions from "Previous Releases" section
  - Added v8.24.1 to Previous Releases list (was missing despite being valid release)
  - Enhanced agent instructions with CRITICAL section for maintaining version history integrity
  - Added quality assurance checklist item to prevent future omissions
  - Root cause: Agent was replacing entire Previous Releases section instead of prepending new version

### Added
- **Test Coverage for Tag+Time Filtering** - Comprehensive test suite for issue #216 (commit ebff282)
  - 10 unit tests passing across SQLite-vec, Cloudflare, and Hybrid backends
  - Validates PR #215 functionality (tag+time filtering to fix semantic over-filtering bug #214)
  - Tests verify memories can be retrieved using both tag criteria AND time range filters
  - API integration tests created (with known threading issues documented for future fix)
  - Ensures regression prevention for semantic search over-filtering bug

### Changed
- GitHub release workflow now more reliable with enhanced agent guardrails
- Test suite provides better coverage for multi-filter memory retrieval scenarios

### Technical Details
- **Files Modified**:
  - `.claude/agents/github-release-manager.md` - Added CRITICAL section for Previous Releases maintenance
  - `tests/test_time_filtering.py` - 10 new unit tests for tag+time filtering
  - `tests/integration/test_api_time_search.py` - API integration tests (threading issues documented)
- **Test Execution**: All 10 unit tests passing, API tests have known threading limitations
- **Impact**: Prevents version history loss in future releases, ensures tag+time filtering remains functional

## [8.24.2] - 2025-11-15

### Fixed
- **CI/CD Workflow Infrastructure** - Development Setup Validation workflow fixes (issue #217 related)
  - Fixed bash errexit handling in workflow tests - prevents premature exit on intentional test failures
  - Corrected exit code capture using EXIT_CODE=0 and || EXIT_CODE=$? pattern
  - All 5 workflow tests now passing: version consistency, pre-commit hooks, server warnings, developer prompts, docs accuracy
  - Root cause: bash runs with -e flag (errexit), which exits immediately when commands return non-zero exit codes
  - Tests intentionally run check_dev_setup.py expecting exit code 1, but bash was exiting before capture
  - Commits: b4f9a5a, d1bcd67

### Changed
- Workflow tests can now properly validate that the development setup validator correctly detects problems
- Exit code capture no longer uses "|| true" pattern (was making all commands return 0)

### Technical Details
- **Files Modified**: .github/workflows/dev-setup-validation.yml
- **Pattern Change**:
  - Before: `python script.py || true` (always returns 0, breaks exit code testing)
  - After: `EXIT_CODE=0; python script.py || EXIT_CODE=$?` (captures actual exit code, prevents bash exit)
- **Test Jobs**: All 5 jobs in dev-setup-validation workflow now pass consistently
- **Context**: Part of test infrastructure improvement efforts (issue #217)

## [8.24.1] - 2025-11-15

### Fixed
- **Test Infrastructure Failures** - Resolved 27 pre-existing test failures (issue #217)
  - Fixed async fixture incompatibility in 6 test files (19+ failures)
  - Corrected missing imports (MCPMemoryServer → MemoryServer, removed MemoryMetadata)
  - Added missing content_hash parameter to Memory() instantiations
  - Updated hardcoded version strings (6.3.0 → 8.24.0)
  - Improved test pass rate from 63% to 71% (412/584 tests passing)
  - Execution: Automated via amp-bridge agent

### Changed
- Test suite now has cleaner baseline for detecting new regressions
- All async test fixtures now use @pytest_asyncio.fixture decorator

### Technical Details
- **Automated Fix**: Used amp-bridge agent for pattern-based refactoring
- **Execution Time**: ~15 minutes (vs 1-2 hours manual)
- **Files Modified**: 11 test files across tests/ and tests/integration/
- **Root Causes**: Test infrastructure issues, not code bugs
- **Remaining Failures**: 172 failures remain (backend config, performance, actual bugs)

## [8.24.0] - 2025-11-12

### Added
- **PyPI Publishing Automation** - Package now available via `pip install mcp-memory-service`
  - **Workflow Automation**: Configured GitHub Actions workflow to automatically publish to PyPI on tag pushes

- **For Existing Users**: No action required - git-based installation continues to work
- **For Contributors**: Tag creation now triggers PyPI publishing automatically

## [8.23.1] - 2025-11-10

### Fixed
- **Stale Virtual Environment Prevention System** - Comprehensive 6-layer strategy to prevent "stale venv vs source code" version mismatches
  - **Root Cause**: MCP servers load from site-packages, not source files. System restart doesn't help - it relaunches with same stale package
  - **Impact**: Prevented issue that caused v8.23.0 tag validation bug to persist despite v8.22.2 fix (source showed v8.23.0 while venv had v8.5.3)

### Added
- **Phase 1: Automated Detection**
  - New `scripts/validation/check_dev_setup.py` - Validates source/venv version consistency, detects editable installs
  - Enhanced `scripts/hooks/pre-commit` - Blocks commits when venv is stale, provides actionable error messages
  - Added CLAUDE.md development setup section with explicit `pip install -e .` guidance

- **Phase 2: Runtime Warnings**
  - Added `check_version_consistency()` function in `src/mcp_memory_service/server.py`

  - Interactive prompt guides developers to use `pip install -e .` for editable installs
  - New CI/CD workflow `.github/workflows/dev-setup-validation.yml` with 5 comprehensive test jobs:
    1. Version consistency validation
    2. Pre-commit hook functionality
    3. Server startup warnings
    4. Interactive developer prompts
    5. Documentation accuracy checks

### Changed
- **Developer Workflow**: Developers now automatically guided to use `pip install -e .` for proper setup
- **Pre-commit Hook**: Now validates venv consistency before allowing commits
- **Installation Process**: Detects developer mode and provides targeted guidance

### Technical Details
- **6-Layer Prevention System**:
  1. **Development**: Pre-commit hook blocks bad commits, detection script validates setup
  2. **Runtime**: Server startup warnings catch edge cases
  3. **Documentation**: CLAUDE.md, README.md, ai-agent-instructions.md all updated
  4. **Automation**: check_dev_setup.py, pre-commit hook, CI/CD workflow
  5. **Interactive**: install.py prompts developers for editable install
  6. **Testing**: CI/CD workflow with 5 comprehensive test jobs

- **Files Modified**:
  - `scripts/validation/check_dev_setup.py` - NEW automated detection script
  - `scripts/hooks/pre-commit` - Enhanced with venv validation
  - `CLAUDE.md` - Added development setup guidance

- `9537259` - Phase 2: Runtime warnings (server.py) + developer documentation
- `a17bcc7` - Phase 3: Interactive onboarding (install.py) + CI/CD validation

## [8.23.0] - 2025-11-10

### Added
- **Consolidation Scheduler via Code Execution API** - Dream-based memory consolidation now operates independently of MCP server
  - **Architecture Shift**: Migrated ConsolidationScheduler from MCP server to HTTP server using Code Execution API (v8.19.0+)
  - **Token Efficiency**: Achieves **88% token reduction** (803K tokens/year saved) by eliminating redundant memory retrieval
  - **24/7 Operation**: Consolidation now runs continuously via HTTP server, independent of Claude Desktop sessions
  - **Code Execution Extensions**:
    - Added `CompactConsolidationResult` and `CompactSchedulerStatus` types for efficient data transfer
    - Implemented `consolidate()` and `scheduler_status()` functions in API operations
    - Enhanced API client with consolidator/scheduler management capabilities
  - **HTTP API Endpoints** (new):
    - `POST /api/consolidation/trigger` - Manual consolidation trigger for specific time horizons
    - `GET /api/consolidation/status` - Scheduler health and job status monitoring
    - `GET /api/consolidation/recommendations` - Analysis-based consolidation suggestions
  - **Graceful Lifecycle**: HTTP server lifespan events handle scheduler startup/shutdown
  - **Dependencies**: Made `apscheduler>=3.11.0` a required dependency (previously optional)
  - **Files Modified**:
    - `src/mcp_memory_service/api/types.py` - New compact result types
    - `src/mcp_memory_service/api/operations.py` - Consolidation functions
    - `src/mcp_memory_service/api/client.py` - Client methods
    - `src/mcp_memory_service/api/__init__.py` - Export updates
    - `src/mcp_memory_service/web/app.py` - Scheduler integration
    - `src/mcp_memory_service/web/api/consolidation.py` - NEW endpoint router
    - `pyproject.toml` - Dependency update

### Changed
- **Consolidation Workflow**: Users can now trigger and monitor consolidation via HTTP API or web dashboard
- **Performance**: Background consolidation no longer impacts MCP server response times
- **Reliability**: Scheduler continues running even when Claude Desktop is closed

### Migration Notes
- **Backward Compatible**: Existing MCP consolidation tools continue to work via Code Execution API
- **HTTP Server Required**: For scheduled consolidation, HTTP server must be running (`export MCP_HTTP_ENABLED=true`)
- **No Action Needed**: Consolidation automatically migrates to HTTP server when enabled

### Technical Details
- **Token Savings Breakdown**:
  - Before: ~900K tokens/year (MCP server retrieval overhead)
  - After: ~97K tokens/year (compact API responses)
  - Reduction: 803K tokens (88% efficiency gain)
- **Execution Model**: Code Execution API handles consolidation in isolated Python environment
- **Scheduler Configuration**: Same settings as before (`.env` or environment variables)

## [8.22.3] - 2025-11-10

### Fixed
- **Complete Tag Schema Validation Fix**: Extended oneOf schema pattern to ALL MCP tools with tags parameter
  - Previous fixes (v8.22.1-v8.22.2) only addressed character-split bugs in handler code
  - Root cause: 7 tools had schemas accepting ONLY arrays, rejecting comma-separated strings at MCP client validation
  - Updated tool schemas to accept both array and string formats using `oneOf` pattern:
    - `update_memory_metadata` (line 1733)
    - `search_by_tag` (line 1428)
    - `delete_by_tag` (line 1475)
    - `delete_by_tags` (line 1506)
    - `delete_by_all_tags` (line 1536)
    - `ingest_document` (line 1958)
    - `ingest_directory` (line 2015)
  - Added `normalize_tags()` calls in all affected handlers to properly parse comma-separated strings
  - Validation now happens gracefully: client accepts both formats, server normalizes to array
  - **Breaking**: Users must reconnect MCP client (`/mcp` in Claude Code) to fetch updated schemas
  - Resolves recurring "Input validation error: 'X' is not of type 'array'" errors

### Technical Details
- **Validation Flow**: MCP client validates against tool schema → Server normalizes tags → Storage processes
- **Schema Pattern**: Each tags parameter now uses `{"oneOf": [{"type": "array"}, {"type": "string"}]}`
- **Handler Updates**: 7 handlers updated to import and call `normalize_tags()` from `services/memory_service.py`
- **File Modified**: `src/mcp_memory_service/server.py` (schemas + handlers)

### Notes
- This completes the tag parsing fix saga (v8.22.1 → v8.22.2 → v8.22.3)
- v8.22.1: Fixed character-split bug in documents.py
- v8.22.2: Extended fix to server.py and cli/ingestion.py handlers
- v8.22.3: Fixed JSON schemas to accept comma-separated strings at validation layer

## [8.22.2] - 2025-11-09

### Fixed
- **Complete Tag Parsing Fix** - Extended v8.22.1 fix to all remaining locations where tag parsing bug existed
  - **Additional Files Fixed**:
    - `src/mcp_memory_service/server.py` - MCP ingest_document and ingest_directory tool handlers (2 locations)
    - `src/mcp_memory_service/cli/ingestion.py` - CLI ingest_file and ingest_directory commands (2 locations)
  - **Root Cause**: Same as v8.22.1 - `.extend()` on comma-separated string treated as character iterable
  - **Impact**: MCP tools and CLI commands now correctly parse comma-separated tags
  - **Database Repair**: 6 additional memories repaired from metadata backup (total 19 across both releases)
  - **Verification**: All tag parsing code paths now include `isinstance()` type checking

## [8.22.1] - 2025-11-09

### Fixed
- **Document Ingestion Tag Parsing** - Fixed critical data corruption bug where tags were stored character-by-character instead of as complete strings
  - **Root Cause**: When `chunk.metadata['tags']` contained a comma-separated string (e.g., `"claude-code-hooks,update-investigation"`), the `extend()` method treated it as an iterable and added each character individually
  - **Symptom**: Tags like `"claude-code-hooks,update-investigation,configuration,breaking-changes"` became `['c','l','a','u','d','e','-','c','o','d','e','-','h','o','o','k','s',',','u','p','d','a','t','e',...]` (80+ character tags per memory)
  - **Impact**: Memories were unsearchable by tags, tag filtering broken, tag display cluttered with single characters
  - **Fix**: Added `isinstance()` type check to detect string vs list, properly split comma-separated strings before extending tag list
  - **Database Repair**: 13 affected memories automatically repaired using metadata field (which stored correct tags)
  - **Files Modified**: `src/mcp_memory_service/web/api/documents.py` (lines 424-430 for single uploads, 536-542 for batch uploads)

## [8.22.0] - 2025-11-09

    - Now correctly shows recent work (e.g., "🕒 today", "📅 2d ago")
    - Resolves memory age display bug (Related: Issue #214)
  - **Timeout Improvements**: Prevents timeouts during DNS retries and slow network operations
    - Increased code execution timeout: 8000ms → 15000ms

    - Removes clutter from old session summaries (e.g., "Date:\n  9.11.")
    - Added re-sanitization after section extraction
  - **Output Visibility**: Restored console.log output for user-visible tree display
    - Critical fix for output regression where tree was invisible to users
  - **Status Bar Improvements**: Added "memories" label for clarity
    - Format: "💭 6 (4 recent) memories" instead of just "💭 6 (4 recent)"
    - Corrected documentation: "static" instead of "300ms updates"
  - **Configuration**: Removed duplicate codeExecution block from config.json
  - Files modified: `core/session-start.js`, `utilities/context-formatter.js`, `statusline.sh`, `README.md`, `config.json`

  - **Impact**: All memory store operations via MCP `server.py` handler failed completely
  - **Fix**: Properly handle `MemoryService.store_memory()` response format:
    - Success (single): `{"success": True, "memory": {...}}`
    - Success (chunked): `{"success": True, "memories": [...], "total_chunks": N}`
    - Failure: `{"success": False, "error": "..."}`
  - **Response Messages**: Now include truncated content hash for verification
  - **Related**: This was part of issue #197 where async/await bug was fixed in v8.16.0, but this response format bug was missed

### Added
- **Integration Tests**: New test suite for MCP handler methods (`tests/integration/test_mcp_handlers.py`)
  - **Coverage**: 11 test cases for `handle_store_memory()`, `handle_retrieve_memory()`, `handle_search_by_tag()`

    - Small datasets (10-100 memories): ~2x faster
    - Medium datasets (100-1000 memories): ~10-50x faster
    - Large datasets (1000+ memories): ~100x+ faster
  - **Memory Usage**: Single memory object vs loading entire dataset into memory

### Added
- **Abstract method `get_by_hash()` in MemoryStorage base class** (storage/base.py)
  - Enforces O(1) direct hash lookup across all storage backends
  - Required implementation for all storage backends
  - Returns `Optional[Memory]` (None if not found)

- **Implemented `get_by_hash()` in CloudflareStorage** (storage/cloudflare.py)
  - Direct D1 SQL query: `SELECT * FROM memories WHERE content_hash = ?`
  - Handles R2 content loading if needed
  - Loads tags separately
  - Follows same pattern as SqliteVecMemoryStorage implementation

### Changed
- **MemoryService.get_memory_by_hash()** now uses direct storage lookup
  - Removed inefficient `get_all_memories()` + filter approach
  - Simplified implementation (5 lines vs 10 lines)
  - Updated docstring to reflect O(1) lookup

### Testing
- **Updated unit tests** (tests/unit/test_memory_service.py)
  - Mocks now use `storage.get_by_hash()` instead of `storage.get_all_memories()`
  - Added assertions to verify method calls
  - All 3 test cases pass (found, not found, error handling)

- **Updated integration tests** (tests/integration/test_api_with_memory_service.py)
  - Mock updated for proper method delegation
  - Real storage backends (SqliteVecMemoryStorage, HybridMemoryStorage) work correctly

### Technical Details
- **Files Modified**: 5 files
  - `src/mcp_memory_service/storage/base.py`: Added abstract `get_by_hash()` method
  - `src/mcp_memory_service/storage/cloudflare.py`: Implemented `get_by_hash()` (40 lines)
  - `src/mcp_memory_service/services/memory_service.py`: Optimized `get_memory_by_hash()`
  - `tests/unit/test_memory_service.py`: Updated mocks
  - `tests/integration/test_api_with_memory_service.py`: Updated mocks

- **Breaking Changes**: None - fully backward compatible
- **All Storage Backends Now Support get_by_hash()**:
  - ✅ SqliteVecMemoryStorage (line 1153)
  - ✅ CloudflareStorage (line 666)
  - ✅ HybridMemoryStorage (line 974, delegates to primary)

## [8.14.1] - 2025-10-31

### Added
- **Type Safety Improvements** - Comprehensive TypedDict definitions for all MemoryService return types
  - **Problem**: All MemoryService methods returned loose `Dict[str, Any]` types, providing no IDE support or compile-time validation
  - **Solution**: Created 14 specific TypedDict classes for structured return types
    - Store operations: `StoreMemorySingleSuccess`, `StoreMemoryChunkedSuccess`, `StoreMemoryFailure`
    - List operations: `ListMemoriesSuccess`, `ListMemoriesError`
    - Retrieve operations: `RetrieveMemoriesSuccess`, `RetrieveMemoriesError`
    - Search operations: `SearchByTagSuccess`, `SearchByTagError`
    - Delete operations: `DeleteMemorySuccess`, `DeleteMemoryFailure`
    - Health operations: `HealthCheckSuccess`, `HealthCheckFailure`
  - **Benefits**:
    - ✅ IDE autocomplete for all return values (type `result["` to see available keys)
    - ✅ Compile-time type checking catches typos (e.g., `result["succes"]` → type error)
    - ✅ Self-documenting API - clear contracts for all methods
    - ✅ Refactoring safety - renaming keys shows all affected code
    - ✅ 100% backward compatible - no runtime changes
    - ✅ Zero performance impact - pure static typing

### Fixed
- **Missing HybridMemoryStorage.get_by_hash()** - Added delegation method to HybridMemoryStorage
  - Fixed `AttributeError: 'HybridMemoryStorage' object has no attribute 'get_by_hash'`
  - All storage backends now implement `get_by_hash()`: SqliteVecMemoryStorage, CloudflareMemoryStorage, HybridMemoryStorage
  - Enables direct memory retrieval by content hash without loading all memories
  - See issue #196 for planned optimization to use this method in MemoryService

### Technical Details
- **Files Modified**:
  - `src/mcp_memory_service/services/memory_service.py`: Added 14 TypedDict classes, updated 6 method signatures
  - `src/mcp_memory_service/storage/hybrid.py`: Added `get_by_hash()` delegation method
- **Breaking Changes**: None - fully backward compatible (TypedDict is structural typing)
- **Testing**: All tests pass (15/15), comprehensive structure validation, HTTP API integration verified

## [8.14.0] - 2025-10-31

### Fixed
- **Comprehensive Tag Normalization** - DRY solution for all tag format handling
  - **Problem**: Inconsistent tag handling across different APIs caused validation errors
    - Top-level `tags` parameter accepted strings, but MemoryService expected arrays
    - `metadata.tags` field had no normalization, causing "is not of type 'array'" errors
    - Comma-separated strings like `"tag1,tag2,tag3"` were not split into arrays
    - Normalization logic was duplicated in some methods but missing in others
  - **Root Cause**:
    - MCP/HTTP adapters accepted `Union[str, List[str], None]` in signatures
    - But passed values to MemoryService without normalization
    - MemoryService expected `Optional[List[str]]`, causing type mismatch
    - `search_by_tag()` had normalization, but `store_memory()` did not (DRY violation)
  - **Solution** (DRY Principle Applied):
    - Created centralized `normalize_tags()` utility function (services/memory_service.py:27-56)
    - Handles ALL input formats:
      - `None` → `[]`
      - `"tag1,tag2,tag3"` → `["tag1", "tag2", "tag3"]`
      - `"single-tag"` → `["single-tag"]`
      - `["tag1", "tag2"]` → `["tag1", "tag2"]` (passthrough)
    - Updated `MemoryService.store_memory()` to:
      - Accept `Union[str, List[str], None]` type hint
      - Normalize both `tags` parameter and `metadata.tags` field
      - Merge tags from both sources with deduplication
    - Updated `MemoryService.search_by_tag()` to use utility (removed duplicate code)
  - **Files Modified**:
    - `src/mcp_memory_service/services/memory_service.py`: Added normalize_tags(), updated store_memory() and search_by_tag()
    - `src/mcp_memory_service/mcp_server.py`: Updated docstring to reflect all formats supported
  - **Benefits**:
    - ✅ Single source of truth for tag normalization (DRY)
    - ✅ All tag formats work everywhere (top-level, metadata, any protocol)
    - ✅ No more validation errors for comma-separated strings
    - ✅ Fully backward compatible
    - ✅ Consistent behavior across all endpoints
  - **User Impact**:
    - Can use any tag format anywhere without errors
    - No need to remember which parameter accepts which format
    - Improved developer experience and reduced friction

### Technical Details
- **Affected Components**: MemoryService (business logic layer), MCP server documentation
- **Breaking Changes**: None - fully backward compatible
- **Tag Merge Behavior**: When tags provided in both parameter and metadata, they are merged and deduplicated
- **Testing**: Verified with all format combinations (None, string, comma-separated, array, metadata.tags)

## [8.13.5] - 2025-10-31

### Fixed
- **Memory Hooks Display Polish** - Visual improvements for cleaner, more professional CLI output
  - **Issue**: Multiple visual inconsistencies in memory hooks tree structure display
  - **Problems Identified**:
    1. Redundant bottom frame (`╰────╯`) after tree naturally ended with `└─`
    2. Wrapped text continuation showing vertical lines (`│`) after last items
    3. Duplicate final summary message ("Context injected") when header already shows count
    4. Embedded formatting (✅, •, markdown) conflicting with tree structure
    5. Excessive content length despite adaptive truncation
  - **Fixes** (commits ed46d24, 998a39c):
    - **Content Sanitization**: Remove checkmarks, bullets, markdown formatting that conflicts with tree characters
    - **Smart Truncation**: Extract first 1-2 sentences for <400 char limits using sentence boundary detection
    - **Tree Continuation Logic**: Last items show clean indentation without vertical lines on wrapped text
    - **Remove Redundant Frame**: Tree ends naturally with `└─`, no separate closing box
    - **Remove Duplicate Message**: Header shows "X memories loaded", no redundant final summary
  - **Files Modified**:
    - `claude-hooks/utilities/context-formatter.js`: Content sanitization, smart truncation, tree continuation fixes
    - `claude-hooks/core/session-start.js`: Removed redundant success message
  - **Result**: Clean, consistent tree structure with proper visual hierarchy and no redundancy
  - **User Impact**: Professional CLI output, easier to scan, maintains continuous blue tree lines properly

### Technical Details
- **Affected Component**: Claude Code memory awareness hooks (SessionStart display)
- **Deployment**: Hooks loaded from repository automatically, no server restart needed
- **Testing**: Verified with mock execution and real Claude Code session

## [8.13.4] - 2025-10-30

### Fixed
- **Critical: Memory Hooks Showing Incorrect Ages** (#195) - Timestamp unit mismatch causing 20,371-day ages
  - **Error**: Memory hooks reporting `avgAge: 20371 days, medianAge: 20371 days` when actual age was 6 days
  - **User Impact**: Recent memories didn't surface, auto-calibration incorrectly triggered "stale memory" warnings
  - **Root Cause** (claude-hooks/utilities/memory-client.js:273): Timestamp unit mismatch
    - HTTP API returns Unix timestamps in **SECONDS**: `1758344479.729`
    - JavaScript `Date()` expects **MILLISECONDS**: Interpreted as `Jan 21, 1970` (55 years ago)
    - Age calculation: `(now - 1758344479ms) / 86400000 = 20371 days`
  - **Symptoms**:
    - `[Memory Age Analyzer] { avgAge: 20371, recentPercent: 0, isStale: true }`
    - Hooks showed "Stale memory set detected (median: 20371d old)"
    - Recent development work (< 7 days) never surfaced in context
  - **Fix** (claude-hooks/utilities/memory-client.js:273-294, commit 5c54894):
    - Convert API timestamps from seconds to milliseconds (`× 1000`)
    - Added year 2100 check (`< 4102444800`) to prevent double-conversion
    - Applied in `_performApiPost()` response handler for both `created_at` and `updated_at`
  - **Result**:
    - `avgAge: 6 days, medianAge: 5 days, recentPercent: 100%, isStale: false`
    - Recent memories surface correctly
    - Auto-calibration works properly
    - Git context weight adjusts based on actual ages
  - **Note**: Affects all users using HTTP protocol for memory hooks

### Technical Details
- **Affected Component**: Claude Code memory awareness hooks (HTTP protocol path)
- **File Changed**: `claude-hooks/utilities/memory-client.js` (lines 273-294)
- **Deployment**: Hooks loaded from repository automatically, no server restart needed
- **Issue**: https://github.com/doobidoo/mcp-memory-service/issues/195

## [8.13.3] - 2025-10-30

### Fixed
- **Critical: MCP Memory Tools Broken** - v8.12.0 regression preventing all MCP memory operations
  - **Error**: `KeyError: 'message'` when calling any MCP memory tool (store, retrieve, search, etc.)
  - **User Impact**: MCP tools completely non-functional - "Error storing memory: 'message'"
  - **Root Cause** (mcp_server.py:175): Return format mismatch between MemoryService and MCP tool expectations
    - MCP tool expects: `{success: bool, message: str, content_hash: str}`
    - MemoryService returns: `{success: bool, memory: {...}}`
    - MCP protocol tries to access missing 'message' field → KeyError
  - **Why It Persisted**: HTTP API doesn't require these specific fields, so integration tests passed
  - **Fix** (mcp_server.py:173-206): Transform MemoryService response to MCP TypedDict format
    - Capture result from MemoryService.store_memory()
    - Extract content_hash from nested memory object
    - Add descriptive "message" field
    - Handle 3 cases: failure (error message), chunked (multiple memories), single memory
  - **Result**: MCP tools now work correctly with proper error messages
  - **Note**: Requires MCP server restart (`/mcp` command in Claude Code) to load fix

### Technical Details
- **Introduced**: v8.12.0 MemoryService architecture refactoring (#176)
- **Affected Tools**: store_memory, all MCP protocol operations
- **HTTP API**: Unaffected (different response format requirements)
- **Test Gap**: No integration tests validating MCP tool response formats

## [8.13.2] - 2025-10-30

### Fixed
- **Memory Sync Script Broken** (#193): Fixed sync_memory_backends.py calling non-existent `store_memory()` method
  - **Error**: `AttributeError: 'CloudflareStorage' object has no attribute 'store_memory'`
  - **User Impact**: Sync script completely non-functional - couldn't sync memories between Cloudflare and SQLite backends
  - **Root Cause** (scripts/sync/sync_memory_backends.py:144-147): Script used old `store_memory()` API that no longer exists
  - **Fix** (#194, b69de83): Updated to use proper `Memory` object creation and `storage.store()` method
    - Create `Memory` object with `content`, `content_hash`, `tags`, `metadata`, `created_at`
    - Call `await target_storage.store(memory_obj)` instead of non-existent `store_memory()`
    - Added safe `.get('metadata', {})` to prevent KeyError on missing metadata
    - Fixed import order to comply with PEP 8 (config → models → storage)
  - **Result**: Sync script now successfully syncs memories between backends
  - **Credit**: Fix by AMP via PR #194, reviewed by Gemini

## [8.13.1] - 2025-10-30

### Fixed
- **Critical Concurrent Access Bug**: MCP server initialization failed with "database is locked" when HTTP server running
  - **Error**: `sqlite3.OperationalError: database is locked` during MCP tool initialization
  - **User Impact**: MCP memory tools completely non-functional while HTTP server running - "this worked before without any flaws"
  - **Root Cause #1** (sqlite_vec.py:329): Connection timeout set AFTER opening database instead of during connection
    - Original: `sqlite3.connect(path)` used default 5-second timeout, then applied `PRAGMA busy_timeout=15000`
    - SQLite only respects timeout parameter passed to `connect()`, not pragma applied afterward
    - MCP server timed out before it could set the higher timeout value
  - **Root Cause #2** (sqlite_vec.py:467-476): Both servers attempting DDL operations (CREATE TABLE, CREATE INDEX) simultaneously
    - Even with WAL mode, DDL operations require brief exclusive locks
    - No detection of already-initialized database before running DDL
  - **Fix #1** (sqlite_vec.py:291-326): Parse `busy_timeout` from `MCP_MEMORY_SQLITE_PRAGMAS` environment variable BEFORE opening connection
    - Convert from milliseconds to seconds (15000ms → 15.0s)
    - Pass timeout to `sqlite3.connect(path, timeout=15.0)` for immediate effect
    - Allows MCP server to wait up to 15 seconds for HTTP server's DDL operations
  - **Fix #2** (sqlite_vec.py:355-373): Detect already-initialized database and skip DDL operations
    - Check if `memories` and `memory_embeddings` tables exist after loading sqlite-vec extension
    - If tables exist, just load embedding model and mark as initialized
    - Prevents "database is locked" errors from concurrent CREATE TABLE/INDEX attempts
  - **Result**: MCP and HTTP servers now coexist without conflicts, maintaining pre-v8.9.0 concurrent access behavior

### Technical Details
- **Timeline**: Bug discovered during memory consolidation testing, fixed same day
- **Affected Versions**: v8.9.0 introduced database lock prevention pragmas but didn't fix concurrent initialization
- **Test Validation**: MCP health check returns healthy with 1857 memories while HTTP server running
- **Log Evidence**: "Database already initialized by another process, skipping DDL operations" confirms fix working

## [8.13.0] - 2025-10-29

### Added
- **HTTP Server Integration Tests** (#190): Comprehensive test suite with 32 tests prevents production bugs like v8.12.0
  - `tests/integration/test_http_server_startup.py`: 8 tests for server startup validation
  - `tests/unit/test_fastapi_dependencies.py`: 11 tests for dependency injection
  - `tests/unit/test_storage_interface_compatibility.py`: 13 tests for backend interface consistency
  - Extended `tests/integration/test_api_with_memory_service.py`: +11 HTTP API tests with TestClient
  - Tests would have caught all 3 v8.12.0 production bugs (import-time evaluation, syntax errors, interface mismatches)

- **Storage Method: get_largest_memories()** (#186): Efficient database queries for largest memories by content length
  - Added to all storage backends (SQLite, Cloudflare, Hybrid)
  - Uses `ORDER BY LENGTH(content) DESC LIMIT n` instead of loading 1000 memories and sorting in Python
  - Analytics dashboard now queries entire dataset for truly largest memories

### Fixed
- **Analytics Dashboard Timezone Bug** (#186): Fixed heatmap calendar showing wrong day-of-week near timezone boundaries
  - JavaScript `new Date('YYYY-MM-DD')` parsed as UTC midnight, but `getDay()` used local timezone
  - Changed to parse date components in local timezone: `new Date(year, month-1, day)`
  - Prevents calendar cells from shifting to previous/next day for users in UTC-12 to UTC+12 timezones

### Improved
- **Analytics Performance**: Reduced memory sample for average size calculation from 1000→100 memories
- **Test Coverage**: Zero HTTP integration tests → 32 comprehensive tests covering server startup, dependencies, and API endpoints

### Documentation
- **MCP Schema Caching** (#173): Closed with comprehensive documentation in CLAUDE.md and troubleshooting guides
  - Root cause: MCP protocol caches tool schemas client-side
  - Workaround: `/mcp` command reconnects server with fresh schema
  - Documented symptoms, diagnosis, and resolution steps

## [8.12.1] - 2025-10-28

### Fixed
- **Critical Production Bug #1** (ef2c64d): Import-time default parameter evaluation in `get_memory_service()`
  - **Error**: `HTTPException: 503: Storage not initialized` during module import
  - **Root Cause**: Python evaluates default parameters at function definition time, not call time
  - **Impact**: HTTP server couldn't start - module import failed immediately
  - **Fix**: Changed from `storage: MemoryStorage = get_storage()` to `storage: MemoryStorage = Depends(get_storage)`
  - **Technical**: FastAPI's `Depends()` defers evaluation until request time and integrates with dependency injection

- **Critical Production Bug #2** (77de4d2): Syntax error + missing FastAPI Depends import in `memories.py`
  - **Error**: `SyntaxError: expected an indented block after 'if' statement on line 152`
  - **Root Cause**: `if INCLUDE_HOSTNAME:` had no indented body, nested if-elif-else block not indented
  - **Impact**: SyntaxError prevented module import + FastAPI validation failure
  - **Fix**: Properly indented hostname resolution logic, added missing `Depends` import to dependencies.py

- **Critical Production Bug #3** (f935c56): Missing `tags` parameter in `count_all_memories()` across all storage backends
  - **Error**: `TypeError: count_all_memories() got an unexpected keyword argument 'tags'`
  - **User Report**: "failed to load dashboard data"
  - **Root Cause**: MemoryService called `count_all_memories(memory_type=type, tags=tags)` but base class and implementations didn't accept tags parameter
  - **Impact**: Dashboard completely broken - GET /api/memories returned 500 errors
  - **Fix**: Updated 4 files (base.py, hybrid.py, sqlite_vec.py, cloudflare.py) to add tags parameter with SQL LIKE filtering
  - **Why Tests Missed It**: AsyncMock accepts ANY parameters, never tested real storage backend implementations

- **Analytics Metrics Bug** (8beeb07): Analytics tab showed different metrics than Dashboard tab
  - **Problem**: Dashboard queried ALL memories, Analytics sampled only 1000 recent memories
  - **Impact**: "This Week" count was inaccurate when total memories > 1000
  - **Fix**: Changed Analytics endpoint to use `storage.get_stats()` instead of sampling
  - **Performance**: Eliminated O(n) memory loading for simple count operation, now uses efficient SQL COUNT

### Changed
- **Analytics Endpoint Performance** - Increased monthly sample from 2,000 to 5,000 memories
- **Code Quality** - Added TODO comments for moving monthly calculations to storage layer

### Technical Details
- **Timeline**: All 4 bugs discovered and fixed within 4 hours of v8.12.0 release (15:03 UTC → 22:03 UTC)
- **Post-Mortem**: Created Issue #190 for HTTP server integration tests to prevent future production bugs
- **Test Coverage Gap**: v8.12.0 had 55 tests but zero HTTP server integration tests
- **Lesson Learned**: Tests used mocked storage that never actually started the server or tested real FastAPI dependency injection

**Note**: This patch release resolves all production issues from v8.12.0 architectural changes. Comprehensive analysis stored in memory with tag `v8.12.0,post-release-bugs`.

  - Impact: Health check functionality completely broken
  - Fix: Changed to use `storage.get_stats()` from base class
- **Critical Bug #5**: `storage.search_by_tags()` method mismatch (plural vs singular)
  - Impact: Tag search functionality completely broken
  - Fix: Changed to use `storage.search_by_tag()` (singular) from base class
- **Critical Bug #6**: Incorrect chunking logic comparing `len(content) > CONTENT_PRESERVE_BOUNDARIES`
  - Impact: ALL content >1 character would trigger chunking (CONTENT_PRESERVE_BOUNDARIES is boolean `True`)
  - Fix: Proper comparison using `storage.max_content_length` numeric value
- **Critical Bug #7**: Missing `store()` return value handling
  - Impact: Success/failure not properly tracked
  - Fix: Proper unpacking of `(success, message)` tuple from storage operations

### Changed
- **API Endpoints** - Refactored to use MemoryService dependency injection
  - `/api/memories` (list, create) uses MemoryService
  - `/api/search` endpoints use MemoryService
  - Consistent response formatting via service layer
- **Code Maintainability** - Removed 356 lines of duplicated code
  - Single place to modify business logic
  - Unified error handling
  - Consistent hostname tagging logic
- **Performance** - Database-level filtering prevents O(n) memory loading
  - Scalable pagination with offset/limit at storage layer
  - Efficient tag and type filtering

### Technical Details
- **Files Modified**: 6 files, 1469 additions, 356 deletions
- **Test Coverage**: 55 new tests (34 unit + 21 integration)
- **Bug Discovery**: Comprehensive testing revealed 7 critical bugs that would have made the release non-functional
- **Quality Process**: Test-driven debugging approach prevented broken release

**Note**: This release demonstrates the critical importance of comprehensive testing before merging architectural changes. All 7 bugs were caught through systematic unit and integration testing.

## [8.9.0] - 2025-10-27

### Fixed
- **Database Lock Prevention** - Resolved "database is locked" errors during concurrent HTTP + MCP server access (Issue discovered during performance troubleshooting)

    - Cloudflare credentials for background sync
    - Proper environment variable propagation
  - **Benefits**:
    - 5ms local reads (SQLite-vec)
    - Zero user-facing latency (background Cloudflare sync)
    - Multi-device synchronization
    - Concurrent access support

### Changed
- **Installer Defaults** - Hybrid backend now recommended for production use
  - Updated argparse choices to include `hybrid` option
  - Changed default selection from sqlite_vec to hybrid (option 4)
  - Enhanced compatibility detection with "recommended" status for hybrid
  - Improved final installation messages with backend-specific guidance

## [8.8.2] - 2025-10-26

### Fixed
- **Document Upload Tag Validation** - Prevents bloated tags from space-separated file paths (Issue #174, PR #179)
  - **Enhanced Tag Parsing**: Split tags by comma OR space instead of comma only
  - **Robust file:// URI Handling**: Uses `urllib.parse` for proper URL decoding and path handling
    - Handles URL-encoded characters (e.g., `%20` for spaces)
    - Handles different path formats (e.g., `file:///C:/...`)
    - Properly handles Windows paths with leading slash from urlparse
  - **File Path Sanitization**: Remove `file://` prefixes, extract filenames only, clean path separators
  - **Explicit Tag Length Validation**: Tags exceeding 100 chars now raise explicit HTTPException instead of being silently dropped

### Added
- **Processing Mode Toggle** - UI enhancement for multiple file uploads (PR #179)
  - **Batch Processing**: All files processed together (faster, default)
  - **Individual Processing**: Each file processed separately with better error isolation
  - Toggle only appears when multiple files are selected

## [8.8.0] - 2025-10-26

### Changed
- **DRY Refactoring** - Eliminated code duplication between MCP and HTTP servers (PR #176, Issue #172)
  - **Problem**: MCP (`mcp_server.py`) and HTTP (`server.py`) servers had 364 lines of duplicated business logic
    - Bug fixes applied to one server were missed in the other (e.g., PR #162 tags validation)
    - Maintenance burden of keeping two implementations synchronized
    - Risk of behavioral inconsistencies between protocols
  - **Solution**:
    - Created `MemoryService` class (442 lines) as single source of truth for business logic
    - Refactored `mcp_server.py` to thin adapter (-338 lines, now ~50 lines per method)
    - Refactored `server.py` to use MemoryService (169 lines modified)
    - Both servers now delegate to shared business logic
  - **Benefits**:
    - **Single source of truth**: All memory operations (store, retrieve, search, delete) in one place
    - **Consistent behavior**: Both protocols guaranteed identical business logic
    - **Easier maintenance**: Bug fixes automatically apply to both servers
    - **Better testability**: Business logic isolated and independently testable
    - **Prevents future bugs**: Impossible to fix one server and forget the other
  - **Type Safety**: Added TypedDict classes (`MemoryResult`, `OperationResult`, `HealthStats`) for better type annotations
  - **Backward Compatibility**: No API changes, both servers remain fully compatible
  - **Testing**: All tests passing (15/15 Cloudflare storage tests)
  - **Review**: Gemini Code Assist: "significant and valuable refactoring... greatly improves maintainability and consistency"
  - **Follow-up**: Minor improvements tracked in Issue #177 (error handling, encapsulation)

### Fixed
- **Python 3.10 Compatibility** - Added `NotRequired` import fallback (src/mcp_memory_service/mcp_server.py:23-26)
  - Uses `typing.NotRequired` on Python 3.11+
  - Falls back to `typing_extensions.NotRequired` on Python 3.10
  - Ensures compatibility across Python versions

### Added
- **Maintenance Scripts** - Cloudflare cleanup utilities (from v8.7.1 work)
  - `scripts/maintenance/find_cloudflare_duplicates.py` - Detect duplicates in Cloudflare D1

## [8.7.1] - 2025-10-26

### Fixed
- **Cloudflare Vectorize Deletion** - Fixed vector deletion endpoint bug (src/mcp_memory_service/storage/cloudflare.py:671)
  - **Problem**: Used incorrect endpoint `/delete-by-ids` (hyphens) causing 404 Not Found errors, preventing vector deletion
  - **Solution**:
    - Changed to correct Cloudflare API endpoint `/delete_by_ids` (underscores)
    - Fixed payload format from `[vector_id]` to `{"ids": [vector_id]}`
    - Created working cleanup script: `scripts/maintenance/delete_orphaned_vectors_fixed.py`
    - Removed obsolete broken script: `scripts/maintenance/delete_orphaned_vectors.py`
  - **Impact**: Successfully deleted 646 orphaned vectors from Vectorize in 7 batches
  - **Testing**: Verified with production data (646 vectors, 100/batch, all mutations successful)
  - **Discovery**: Found via web research of official Cloudflare Vectorize API documentation

## [8.7.0] - 2025-10-26

### Fixed
- **Cosine Similarity Migration** - Fixed 0% similarity scores in search results (src/mcp_memory_service/storage/sqlite_vec.py:187)
  - **Problem**: L2 distance metric gave 0% similarity for all searches due to score calculation `max(0, 1-distance)` returning 0 for distances >1.0
  - **Solution**:
    - Migrated embeddings table from L2 to cosine distance metric
    - Updated score calculation to `1.0 - (distance/2.0)` for cosine range [0,2]
    - Added automatic migration logic with database locking retry (exponential backoff)
    - Implemented `_initialized` flag to prevent multiple initialization
    - Created metadata table for storage configuration persistence
  - **Performance**: Search scores improved from 0% to 70-79%, exact match accuracy 79.2% (was 61%)
  - **Impact**: 2605 embeddings regenerated successfully

- **Dashboard Search Improvements** - Enhanced search threshold handling (src/mcp_memory_service/web/static/app.js:283)
  - Fixed search threshold always being sent even when not explicitly set
  - Improved document filtering to properly handle memory object structure
  - Only send `similarity_threshold` parameter when user explicitly sets it
  - Better handling of `memory.memory_type` and `memory.tags` for document results

  - **regenerate_embeddings.py** - Regenerate all embeddings after migrations (~5min for 2600 memories)
  - **fast_cleanup_duplicates.sh** - 1800x faster duplicate removal using direct SQL (<5s for 100+ duplicates vs 2.5 hours via API)
  - **find_all_duplicates.py** - Fast duplicate detection with timestamp normalization (<2s for 2000 memories)
  - **README.md** - Complete documentation with performance benchmarks, best practices, and troubleshooting

### Technical Details
- **Migration Approach**: Drop-and-recreate embeddings table to change distance metric (vec0 limitation)
- **Retry Logic**: Exponential backoff for database locking (1s → 2s → 4s delays)
- **Performance Benchmark**: Direct SQL vs API operations show 1800x speedup for bulk deletions
- **Duplicate Detection**: Content normalization removes timestamps for semantic comparison using MD5 hashing

## [8.5.14] - 2025-10-23

### Added
- **Memory Hooks: Expanded Git Keyword Extraction** - Dramatically improved memory retrieval by capturing more relevant technical terms from git commits
  - **Problem**: Limited keyword extraction (only 12 terms) missed important development context
    - Git analyzer captured only generic terms: `fix, memory, chore, feat, refactor`
    - Recent work on timestamp parsing, dashboard, analytics not reflected in queries
    - Version numbers (v8.5.12, v8.5.13) not extracted
    - Memory hooks couldn't match against specific technical work
  - **Solution**: Expanded keyword extraction in `git-analyzer.js`
    - **Technical Terms**: Increased from 12 to 38 terms including:
      - Time/Date: `timestamp, parsing, sort, sorting, date, age`
      - Dashboard: `dashboard, analytics, footer, layout, grid, css, stats, display`
      - Development: `async, sync, bugfix, release, version`
      - Features: `embedding, consolidation, memory, retrieval, scoring`
      - Infrastructure: `api, endpoint, server, http, mcp, client, protocol`
    - **Version Extraction**: Added regex to capture version numbers (v8.5.12, v8.5.13, etc.)
    - **Changelog Terms**: Expanded from 12 to 23 terms with same additions
    - **Keyword Limits**: Increased capacity
      - keywords: 15 → 20 terms
      - themes: 10 → 12 entries
      - filePatterns: 10 → 12 entries
  - **Impact**:
    - **Before**: 5 generic terms → limited semantic matching
    - **After**: 20 specific development terms → precise context retrieval
    - Example: `feat, git, memory, retrieval, fix, timestamp, age, v8.5.8, chore, version, v8.5.13, sort, date, dashboard, analytics, stats, display, footer, layout, v8.5.12`
  - **Result**: Memory hooks now capture and retrieve memories about specific technical work (releases, features, bugfixes)
  - **Files Modified**:
    - `claude-hooks/utilities/git-analyzer.js` - Expanded `extractDevelopmentKeywords()` function (commit 4a02c1a)
  - **Testing**: Verified improved extraction with test run showing 20 relevant keywords vs previous 5 generic terms

## [8.5.13] - 2025-10-23

### Fixed
- **Memory Hooks: Unix Timestamp Parsing in Date Sorting** - Fixed critical bug where memories were not sorting chronologically in Claude Code session start
  - **Root Cause**: JavaScript `Date()` constructor expects milliseconds but API returns Unix timestamps in seconds
  - **Impact**: Memory hooks showed old memories (Oct 11-21) before recent ones (Oct 23) despite `sortByCreationDate: true` configuration
  - **Technical Details**:
    - API returns `created_at` as Unix timestamp in seconds (e.g., 1729700000)
    - JavaScript `new Date(1729700000)` interprets this as milliseconds → January 21, 1970
    - All dates appeared as 1970-01-01, breaking chronological sort
    - Relevance scores then determined order, causing old high-scoring memories to rank first
  - **Fix**:
    - Created `getTimestamp()` helper function in `session-start.js` (lines 907-928)
    - Converts `created_at` (seconds) to milliseconds by multiplying by 1000
    - Falls back to `created_at_iso` string parsing if available
    - Proper date comparison ensures newest memories sort first
  - **Result**: Memory hooks now correctly show most recent project memories at session start
  - **Files Modified**:
    - `claude-hooks/core/session-start.js` - Added Unix timestamp conversion helper (commit 71606e5)

## [8.5.12] - 2025-10-23

### Fixed
- **Dashboard: Analytics Stats Display** - Fixed analytics tab showing 0/N/A for key metrics
  - **Root Cause**: Async/sync mismatch in `get_stats()` method implementations
  - **Impact**: Analytics dashboard displayed only "this week" count; total memories, unique tags, and database size showed 0 or N/A
  - **Fix**:
    - Made `SqliteVecMemoryStorage.get_stats()` async (line 1242)
    - Updated `HybridMemoryStorage.get_stats()` to properly await primary storage call (line 878)
    - Added `database_size_bytes` and `database_size_mb` to hybrid stats response
    - Fixed all callers in `health.py` and `mcp.py` to await `get_stats()`
  - **Result**: All metrics now display correctly (1778 memories, 2549 tags, 7.74MB)
  - **Files Modified**:
    - `src/mcp_memory_service/storage/sqlite_vec.py` - Made get_stats() async
    - `src/mcp_memory_service/storage/hybrid.py` - Added await and database size fields
    - `src/mcp_memory_service/web/api/health.py` - Simplified async handling
    - `src/mcp_memory_service/web/api/mcp.py` - Added await calls

- **Dashboard: Footer Layout** - Fixed footer appearing between header and content instead of at bottom
  - **Root Cause**: Footer not included in CSS grid layout template
  - **Impact**: Broken visual layout with footer misplaced in page flow
  - **Fix**:
    - Updated `.app-container` grid to include 5th row with "footer" area
    - Assigned `grid-area: footer` to `.app-footer` class
  - **Result**: Footer now correctly positioned at bottom of page
  - **Files Modified**:
    - `src/mcp_memory_service/web/static/style.css` - Updated grid layout (lines 101-110, 1899)

- **HTTP Server: Runtime Warnings** - Eliminated "coroutine was never awaited" warnings in logs
  - **Root Cause**: Legacy sync/async detection code after all backends became async
  - **Impact**: Runtime warnings cluttering server logs
  - **Fix**: Removed hybrid backend detection logic, all `get_stats()` calls now consistently await
  - **Result**: Clean server logs with no warnings

## [8.5.11] - 2025-10-23

### Fixed
- **Consolidation System: Embedding Retrieval in get_all_memories()** - Fixed SQLite-vec backend to actually retrieve embeddings (PR #171, fixes #169)
  - **Root Cause**: `get_all_memories()` methods only queried `memories` table without joining `memory_embeddings` virtual table
  - **Impact**: Consolidation system received 0 embeddings despite 1773 memories in database, preventing association discovery and semantic clustering
  - **Discovery**: PR #170 claimed to fix this but only modified debug tools; actual fix required changes to `sqlite_vec.py`
  - **Fix**:
    - Added `deserialize_embedding()` helper function using numpy.frombuffer() (sqlite-vec only provides serialize, not deserialize)
    - Updated both `get_all_memories()` methods (lines 1468 and 1681) with LEFT JOIN to `memory_embeddings` table
    - Modified `_row_to_memory()` helper to handle 10-column rows with embeddings
    - Applied Gemini Code Assist improvement to simplify row unpacking logic
  - **Test Results** (1773 memories):
    - Embeddings retrieved: 1773/1773 (100%)
    - Associations discovered: 90-91 (0.3-0.7 similarity range)
    - Semantic clusters created: 3 (DBSCAN grouping)
    - Performance: 1249-1414 memories/second
    - Duration: 1.25-1.42 seconds
  - **Consolidation Status**: ✅ **FULLY FUNCTIONAL** (all three blockers fixed: PR #166, #168, #171)
  - **Files Modified**:
    - `src/mcp_memory_service/storage/sqlite_vec.py` - Added embedding retrieval to all memory fetch operations

## [8.5.10] - 2025-10-23

### Fixed
- **Debug Tools: Embedding Retrieval Functionality** - Fixed debug MCP tools for SQLite-vec backend (PR #170, addresses #169)
  - **Root Cause**: `debug_retrieve_memory` function was written for ChromaDB but codebase now uses SQLite-vec storage
  - **Impact**: Debug tools (`debug_retrieve`) were broken, preventing debugging of embedding retrieval operations
  - **Fix**: Updated debug utilities to work with current SQLite-vec storage backend
  - **Changes**:
    - Fixed `debug_retrieve_memory` in `src/mcp_memory_service/utils/debug.py` to use storage's `retrieve()` method
    - Enhanced debug output with similarity scores, backend information, query details, and raw distance values
    - Added proper filtering by similarity threshold
  - **Files Modified**:
    - `src/mcp_memory_service/utils/debug.py` - Updated for SQLite-vec compatibility
    - `src/mcp_memory_service/server.py` - Enhanced debug output formatting

### Added
- **Debug Tool: get_raw_embedding MCP Tool** - New debugging capability for embedding inspection (PR #170)
  - **Purpose**: Direct debugging of embedding generation process
  - **Features**:
    - Shows raw embedding vectors with configurable display (first 10 and last 10 values for readability)
    - Displays embedding dimensions
    - Shows generation status and error messages
  - **Use Case**: Troubleshooting embedding-related issues in consolidation and semantic search
  - **Files Modified**:
    - `src/mcp_memory_service/server.py` - Added `get_raw_embedding` tool and handler

## [8.5.9] - 2025-10-22

### Fixed
- **Consolidation System: Missing update_memory() Method** - Added `update_memory()` method to all storage backends (PR #166, fixes #165)
  - **Root Cause**: Storage backends only implemented `update_memory_metadata()`, but consolidation system's `StorageProtocol` required `update_memory()` for saving consolidated results
  - **Impact**: Prevented consolidation system from saving associations, clusters, compressions, and archived memories
  - **Fix**: Added `update_memory()` method to base `MemoryStorage` class, delegating to `update_memory_metadata()` for proper implementation
  - **Affected Backends**: CloudflareStorage, SqliteVecMemoryStorage, HybridMemoryStorage
  - **Test Results**:
    - Verified on SQLite-vec backend with 1773 memories
    - Performance: 5011 memories/second (local SQLite-vec) vs 2.5 mem/s (Cloudflare)
    - Method successfully executes without AttributeError
  - **Files Modified**:
    - `src/mcp_memory_service/storage/base.py` - Added `update_memory()` to base class
    - `src/mcp_memory_service/storage/http_client.py` - Updated HTTP client call
    - `src/mcp_memory_service/storage/hybrid.py` - Fixed method reference

- **Consolidation System: Datetime Timezone Mismatch** - Fixed timezone handling in decay calculator (PR #168, fixes #167)
  - **Root Cause**: Mixed offset-naive and offset-aware datetime objects causing `TypeError` when calculating time differences
  - **Location**: `src/mcp_memory_service/consolidation/decay.py:191` in `_calculate_access_boost()`
  - **Impact**: Blocked decay calculator from completing, preventing associations, clustering, compression, and archival
  - **Fix**: Added timezone normalization to ensure both `current_time` and `last_accessed` are timezone-aware (UTC) before subtraction
  - **Implementation**:
    - Check if datetime is timezone-naive and convert to UTC if needed
    - Ensures consistent timezone handling across all datetime operations
  - **Files Modified**:
    - `src/mcp_memory_service/consolidation/decay.py` - Added timezone normalization logic

### Added
- **Consolidation Documentation** - Comprehensive setup and testing guides
  - `CONSOLIDATION_SETUP.md` - Complete configuration guide for dream-inspired memory consolidation
  - `CONSOLIDATION_TEST_RESULTS.md` - Expected results and troubleshooting guide
  - Documentation covers all 7 consolidation engines and 7 MCP tools

## [8.5.8] - 2025-10-22

### Fixed
- **Critical: Memory Age Calculation in Hooks** - Fixed Unix timestamp handling that caused memories to appear 20,363 days old (55 years) when they were actually recent
  - **Root Cause**: JavaScript's `Date()` constructor expects milliseconds, but SQLite database stores Unix timestamps in seconds. Three functions incorrectly treated seconds as milliseconds: `calculateTimeDecay()`, `calculateRecencyBonus()`, and `analyzeMemoryAgeDistribution()`
  - **Symptoms**:
    - Memory Age Analyzer showed `avgAge: 20363` days instead of actual age
    - Stale memory detection incorrectly triggered (`isStale: true`)
    - Recent memory percentage showed 0% when should be 100%
    - Time decay scores incorrect (1% instead of 100% for today's memories)
    - Recency bonus not applied (0% instead of +15%)
  - **Fix**: Added type checking to convert Unix timestamps properly - multiply by 1000 when timestamp is a number (seconds), pass through when it's an ISO string
  - **Impact**: Memory age calculations now accurate, stale detection works correctly, recency bonuses applied properly
  - **Files Modified**:
    - `claude-hooks/utilities/memory-scorer.js` (lines 11-17, 237-243, 524-534)
  - **Test Results**: Memories now show correct ages (0.4 days vs 20,363 days before fix)
  - **Platform**: All platforms (macOS, Linux, Windows)

### Changed
- **Installer Enhancement**: Added automatic statusLine configuration for v8.5.7 features
  - Installer now copies `statusline.sh` to `~/.claude/hooks/`
  - Checks for `jq` dependency (required for statusLine parsing)
  - Automatically adds `statusLine` configuration to `settings.json`
  - Enhanced documentation for statusLine setup and requirements

### Documentation
- Added `jq` as required dependency for statusLine feature
- Documented statusLine configuration in README.md installation section
- Clarified Unix timestamp handling in memory-scorer.js code comments

## [8.5.6] - 2025-10-16

### Fixed
- **Critical: Memory Hooks HTTPS SSL Certificate Validation** - Fixed hooks failing to connect to HTTPS server with self-signed certificates
  - **Root Cause**: Node.js HTTPS requests were rejecting self-signed SSL certificates silently, causing "No active connection available" errors
  - **Symptoms**:
    - Hooks showed "Failed to connect using any available protocol"
    - No memories retrieved despite server being healthy
    - HTTP server running but hooks couldn't establish connection
  - **Fix**: Added `rejectUnauthorized: false` to both health check and API POST request options in memory-client.js
  - **Impact**: Hooks now successfully connect via HTTPS to servers with self-signed certificates
  - **Files Modified**:
    - `claude-hooks/utilities/memory-client.js` (lines 174, 257)
    - `~/.claude/hooks/utilities/memory-client.js` (deployed)
  - **Test Results**: ✅ 7 memories retrieved from 1558 total, all phases working correctly
  - **Platform**: All platforms (macOS, Linux, Windows)

### Changed
- Memory hooks now support HTTPS endpoints with self-signed certificates without manual certificate trust configuration

## [8.5.5] - 2025-10-14

### Fixed
- **Critical: Claude Code Hooks Configuration** - Fixed session-start hook hanging/unresponsiveness on Windows
  - **Root Cause**: Missing forced process exit in session-start.js caused Node.js event loop to remain active with unclosed connections
  - **Fix 1**: Added `.finally()` block with 100ms delayed `process.exit(0)` to ensure clean termination
  - **Fix 2**: Corrected port mismatch in `~/.claude/hooks/config.json` (8889 → 8000) to match HTTP server
  - **Impact**: Hooks now complete in <15 seconds without hanging, Claude Code remains responsive
  - **Files Modified**:
    - `~/.claude/hooks/core/session-start.js` (lines 1010-1013)
    - `~/.claude/hooks/config.json` (line 7)
  - **Platform**: Windows (also applies to macOS/Linux)

### Changed
- **Documentation**: Added critical warning section to CLAUDE.md about hook configuration synchronization
  - Documents port mismatch symptoms (hanging hooks, unresponsive Claude Code, connection timeouts)
  - Lists all configuration files to check (`config.json`, HTTP server port, dashboard port)
  - Provides verification commands for Windows/Linux/macOS
  - Explains common mistakes (using dashboard port 8888/8443 instead of API port 8000)

## [8.5.4] - 2025-10-13

### Fixed
- **MCP Server**: Added explicit documentation to `store_memory` tool clarifying that `metadata.tags` must be an array, not a comma-separated string
  - Prevents validation error: `Input validation error: '...' is not of type 'array'`
  - Includes clear examples showing correct (array) vs incorrect (string) format
  - Documentation-only change - no code logic modified

### Changed
- Improved `store_memory` tool docstring with metadata format validation examples in `src/mcp_memory_service/mcp_server.py`

## [Unreleased]

- Clarified that HTTP server is **required** for hooks (stdio MCP cannot be used)

**Root Cause:** Many installations had hooks configured for port 8889 while HTTP server runs on port 8000 (default in .env). This caused silent failures where hooks couldn't connect.

**Solution:**
1. Update hooks config endpoint to `http://127.0.0.1:8000`
2. Verify with: `systemctl --user status mcp-memory-http.service`
3. Test with: `curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/health`

### 🔧 **Changed**

- Service files now use `WantedBy=default.target` for user services (not multi-user.target)
- Removed `User=` and `Group=` directives from user service (causes GROUP error)
- Enhanced error messages and troubleshooting documentation

### 🎨 **Improved**

## [8.5.3] - 2025-10-12

### 🐛 **Fixed**

#### **Critical Memory Hooks Bug Fixes (Claude Code Integration)**
Fixed critical bugs preventing memory retrieval in Claude Code session-start hooks. Memory awareness now works correctly with both semantic and time-based searches.

**Problem**: Memory hooks showed "No relevant memories found" despite 1,419 memories in database. Retrieved memories were unrelated (from wrong projects) and sorted incorrectly (oldest first).

**Root Causes Fixed:**

1. **Empty Semantic Query Bug** (search.py:264-272)
   - **Issue**: `storage.retrieve("")` with empty string returned no results
   - **Fix**: Now uses `get_recent_memories()` when `semantic_query` is empty
   - **Impact**: Time-based searches without semantic filtering now work correctly

2. **Missing Time Expression** (search.py:401-403)
   - **Issue**: Hook sends `'last-2-weeks'` but parser didn't recognize it
   - **Fix**: Added support for 'last 2 weeks', 'past 2 weeks', 'last-2-weeks'
   - **Impact**: Phase 2 fallback queries now work properly

3. **Performance Optimization** (search.py:36)
   - **Change**: Reduced candidate pool from 1000 to 100 for time filtering
   - **Rationale**: Prevents timeout on large databases, improves response time
   - **Impact**: Search completes in <100ms vs timing out

4. **CRITICAL: Missing `await` Keywords** (hybrid.py:912, 916, 935, 947)
   - **Issue**: 4 async methods returned unawaited coroutines, causing server hangs
   - **Methods Fixed**:
     - Line 912: `get_all_tags()`
     - Line 916: `get_recent_memories(n)` ⭐ **THE CRITICAL ONE**
     - Line 935: `recall_memory(query, n_results)`
     - Line 947: `get_memories_by_time_range(start_time, end_time)`
   - **Impact**: Hybrid backend now works perfectly (11ms response time!)

5. **JavaScript Refactoring** (memory-client.js:213-293)
   - **Issue**: ~100 lines of duplicated HTTP request code
   - **Fix**: Created `_performApiPost()` helper to eliminate duplication
   - **Impact**: Improved maintainability, DRY compliance

6. **Port Consistency** (memory-client.js:166)
   - **Issue**: Health checks used standard web ports (443/80) while API calls used dev ports (8443/8889)
   - **Fix**: Made both use development ports consistently
   - **Impact**: Prevents connection failures with development endpoints

**Testing & Verification:**
```bash
# Before fix: Timeout
curl -s -m 5 "http://127.0.0.1:8889/api/search/by-time" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"query":"last-2-weeks","n_results":10}'
# (hangs indefinitely)

# After fix: Success
curl -s -m 5 "http://127.0.0.1:8889/api/search/by-time" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"query":"last-2-weeks","n_results":10}'
# Status: 200 (11ms)
# Results: 5 memories retrieved
```

**Files Modified:**
- `src/mcp_memory_service/web/api/search.py` - Empty query fix, time expression, pool size, UTC timezone
- `src/mcp_memory_service/storage/hybrid.py` - Fixed 4 missing await keywords
- `claude-hooks/utilities/memory-client.js` - Refactored HTTP helpers, port consistency, API contract
- `claude-hooks/core/session-start.js` - Updated hardcoded endpoint fallbacks
- `claude-hooks/config.json` - HTTP endpoint configuration

**Code Review**: All fixes reviewed and approved by Gemini Code Assist with PEP 8 compliance, timezone-aware datetimes, list comprehensions, and proper error handling.

**PR Reference**: [#156](https://github.com/doobidoo/mcp-memory-service/pull/156)

## [8.5.2] - 2025-10-11

### 🐛 **Fixed**

#### **v8.5.0 Implementation Missing (Code Completion)**
Complete implementation of Hybrid Backend Sync Dashboard feature that was documented in v8.5.0 CHANGELOG but code was never committed.

**Context**: v8.5.0 release (c241292) included CHANGELOG documentation and version bump but the actual implementation files were accidentally not staged/committed. This release completes the v8.5.0 feature by committing the missing implementation code.

**Impact**: Users can now access the complete Hybrid Backend Sync Dashboard feature including manual sync triggers and real-time status monitoring as originally intended in v8.5.0.

## [8.5.1] - 2025-10-11

### 🎯 **New Features**

#### **Dynamic Memory Weight Adjustment (Claude Code Hooks)**
Intelligent auto-calibration prevents stale memories from dominating session context when recent development exists.

**Problem Solved:**
Users reported "Current Development" section showing outdated memories (24-57 days old) instead of recent work from the last 7 days. Root cause: static configuration couldn't adapt to mismatches between git activity and memory age.

**Solution - Memory Age Distribution Analyzer:**
- **Auto-Detection**: Analyzes memory age percentiles (median, p75, p90, avg)
- **Staleness Detection**: Triggers when median > 30 days or < 20% recent memories
- **Smart Calibration**: Automatically adjusts weights:
  - `timeDecay`: 0.25 → 0.50 (+100% boost for recent memories)
  - `tagRelevance`: 0.35 → 0.20 (-43% reduce old tag matches)
- **Impact**: Stale memory sets automatically prioritize any recent memories

**Solution - Adaptive Git Context Weight:**
- **Scenario 1**: Recent commits (< 7d) + Stale memories (median > 30d)
  - Reduces git weight by 30%: `1.8x → 1.3x`
  - Prevents old git-related memories from dominating
- **Scenario 2**: Recent commits + Recent memories (both < 14d)
  - Keeps configured weight: `1.8x → 1.8x`
  - Git context is relevant and aligned
- **Scenario 3**: Old commits (> 14d) + Some recent memories
  - Reduces git weight by 15%: `1.8x → 1.5x`
  - Lets recent non-git memories surface

**Configuration Options:**
```json
{
  "memoryScoring": {
    "autoCalibrate": true  // Enable/disable auto-calibration
  },
  "gitAnalysis": {
    "adaptiveGitWeight": true  // Enable/disable adaptive git weight
  }
}
```

**Transparency Output:**
```
🎯 Auto-Calibration → Stale memory set detected (median: 54d old, 0% recent)
   Adjusted Weights → timeDecay: 0.50, tagRelevance: 0.20
⚙️  Adaptive Git Weight → Recent commits (1d ago) but stale memories - reducing git boost: 1.8 → 1.3
```

**Files Added:**
- `claude-hooks/test-adaptive-weights.js` - Comprehensive test scenarios

**Files Modified:**
- `claude-hooks/utilities/memory-scorer.js` (+162 lines):
  - `analyzeMemoryAgeDistribution()` - Detects staleness and recommends adjustments
  - `calculateAdaptiveGitWeight()` - Dynamically adjusts git boost based on context alignment
- `claude-hooks/core/session-start.js` (+60 lines):
  - Integrated age analysis before scoring
  - Auto-calibration logic with config check
  - Adaptive git weight calculation with transparency output
- `claude-hooks/config.json` (+2 options):
  - Added `memoryScoring.autoCalibrate: true` (default enabled)
  - Added `gitAnalysis.adaptiveGitWeight: true` (default enabled)

**Benefits:**
- ✅ **Automatic Detection**: No manual config changes when memories become stale
- ✅ **Context-Aware**: Git boost only applies when it enhances (not harms) relevance
- ✅ **Transparent**: Shows reasoning for adjustments in session output
- ✅ **Opt-Out Available**: Users can disable via config if desired
- ✅ **Backward Compatible**: Defaults preserve existing behavior when memories are recent

**Test Results:**
- Scenario 1 (Stale): Automatically calibrated weights and reduced git boost 1.8x → 1.3x
- Scenario 2 (Recent): No calibration needed, preserved git weight at 1.8x
- Both scenarios working as expected, preventing outdated context issues

## [8.5.0] - 2025-10-11

### 🎉 **New Features**

#### **Hybrid Backend Sync Dashboard**
Manual sync management UI with real-time status monitoring for hybrid storage backend.

**Features:**
- **Sync Status Bar** - Color-coded visual indicator between navigation and main content
  - 🔄 Syncing (blue gradient) - Active synchronization in progress
  - ⏱️ Pending (yellow gradient) - Operations queued, shows ETA and count
  - ✅ Synced (green gradient) - All operations synchronized, shows last sync time
  - ⚠️ Error (red gradient) - Sync failures detected, shows failed operation count
- **"Sync Now" Button** - Manual trigger for immediate Cloudflare ↔ SQLite synchronization
- **Real-time Monitoring** - 10-second polling for live sync status updates
- **REST API Endpoints:**
  - `GET /api/sync/status` - Current sync state, pending operations, last sync time
  - `POST /api/sync/force` - Manually trigger immediate sync

**Technical Implementation:**
- New sync API router: `src/mcp_memory_service/web/api/sync.py` (complete CRUD endpoints)
- Frontend integration: `src/mcp_memory_service/web/static/app.js:379-485` (status monitoring + manual sync)
- CSS styling: `src/mcp_memory_service/web/static/style.css:292-403` (grid layout + animations)
- HTML structure: `src/mcp_memory_service/web/static/index.html:125-138` (sync bar markup)
- Backend method: `src/mcp_memory_service/storage/hybrid.py:982-994` (added `get_sync_status()`)

### 🐛 **Fixed**

- **CSS Grid Layout Bug** - Sync status bar invisible despite JavaScript detecting hybrid mode
  - **Root Cause**: `.app-container` grid layout defined `"header" "nav" "main"` but sync bar wasn't assigned a grid area
  - **Fix**: Added `grid-area: sync` to `.sync-status-bar` and expanded grid to include sync row
  - **Files**: `style.css:101-109` (grid layout), `style.css:293` (sync bar grid area)

- **Sync Status Logic Error** - "Sync Now" button incorrectly disabled when background service running
  - **Root Cause**: Confused `is_running` (service alive) with `actively_syncing` (active sync operation)
  - **Fix**: Changed status determination to check `actively_syncing` field instead of `is_running`
  - **Impact**: Button now correctly enabled when 0 pending operations
  - **File**: `src/mcp_memory_service/web/api/sync.py:106-118`

- **Database Path Mismatch** - HTTP server using different SQLite database than Claude Code MCP
  - **Root Cause**: Missing `MCP_MEMORY_SQLITE_PATH` environment variable in HTTP server startup
  - **Fix**: Added explicit database path to match Claude Desktop config
  - **File**: `start_http_server.sh:4` (added `MCP_MEMORY_SQLITE_PATH` export)

- **Backend Configuration Inconsistency** - Claude Desktop using `cloudflare` backend while HTTP server using `hybrid`
  - **Root Cause**: Mismatched storage backend configurations preventing data synchronization
  - **Fix**: Unified both to use `hybrid` backend with same SQLite database
  - **File**: `claude_desktop_config.json:70` (changed `"cloudflare"` → `"hybrid"`)
  - **Impact**: Dashboard now shows same 1413 memories as Claude Code

### 🔧 **Improvements**

- **Enhanced Health Check** - `/api/health/detailed` now includes sync status for hybrid backend
  - Shows sync service state, pending operations, last sync time, failed operations
  - File: `src/mcp_memory_service/web/api/health.py:141-154`

- **Cleaned Database Files** - Removed obsolete SQLite databases to prevent confusion
  - Deleted: `memory_http.db` (701 memories), `backup_sqlite_vec.db`, `sqlite_vec_backup_20250822_230643.db`

- **Updated Startup Script** - `start_http_server.sh` now includes all required environment variables
  - Added: `MCP_MEMORY_SQLITE_PATH`, `MCP_HTTP_ENABLED`
  - Ensures HTTP server uses same database as Claude Code

### 📊 **Impact**

- **User Experience**: Dashboard now provides complete visibility and control over hybrid backend synchronization
- **Data Consistency**: Unified backend configuration ensures Claude Code and HTTP dashboard always show same data
- **Performance**: Manual sync trigger allows immediate synchronization instead of waiting 5 minutes
- **Reliability**: Fixed grid layout bug ensures sync status bar always visible when in hybrid mode

## [8.4.3] - 2025-10-11

### 🐛 Fixed
- **Sync Script Import Path:** Fixed `scripts/sync/sync_memory_backends.py` module import path to work correctly from scripts directory
  - Changed `sys.path.insert(0, str(Path(__file__).parent.parent))` → `sys.path.insert(0, str(Path(__file__).parent.parent.parent))`
  - Resolves `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'src'` when using manual sync commands
  - Fixes: `python scripts/sync/claude_sync_commands.py backup/restore/sync` commands

### 📊 Impact
- Users can now successfully run manual sync utilities for hybrid backend
- Manual Cloudflare ↔ SQLite synchronization commands now functional

## [8.4.2] - 2025-10-11

### 🎯 **Performance & Optimization**

#### **Additional MCP Context Optimization: Debug Tools Removal**
- **Problem**: Continuing context optimization efforts from v8.4.1, identified 2 additional low-value debug tools
- **Solution**: Removed debug/maintenance MCP tools with zero test dependencies

**Tools Removed:**
- `get_embedding` (606 tokens) - Returns raw embedding vectors; low-level debugging only
- `check_embedding_model` (553 tokens) - Checks if embedding model loaded; errors surface naturally

**Rationale:** These were specialized debugging tools rarely needed in practice. Embedding errors are caught during normal retrieval operations, and raw embedding inspection is a niche development task not required for AI assistant integration.

**Impact:**
- ✅ **MCP tools**: 26.8k → 25.6k tokens (4.5% additional reduction, -1.2k tokens)
- ✅ **Total optimization since v8.4.0**: 31.4k → 25.6k tokens (18.5% reduction, -5.8k tokens saved)
- ✅ **Zero breaking changes**: No test coverage for these tools
- ✅ **Conservative approach**: Removed only tools with no dependencies

**Files Modified:**
- `src/mcp_memory_service/server.py`: Removed 2 tool definitions, handlers, and implementations (~61 lines)

**Note:** Further optimization possible with MODERATE approach (debug_retrieve, exact_match_retrieve, cleanup_duplicates) if additional context savings needed.

## [8.4.1] - 2025-10-11

### 🎯 **Performance & Optimization**

#### **MCP Context Optimization: Dashboard Tools Removal**
- **Problem**: MCP tools consuming 31.4k tokens (15.7% of context budget) with redundant dashboard variants that duplicated web UI functionality
- **Solution**: Removed 8 dashboard-specific MCP tools that were unnecessary for Claude Code integration

**Tools Removed:**
- `dashboard_check_health`, `dashboard_recall_memory`, `dashboard_retrieve_memory`
- `dashboard_search_by_tag`, `dashboard_get_stats`, `dashboard_optimize_db`
- `dashboard_create_backup`, `dashboard_delete_memory`

**Rationale:** Web dashboard uses REST API endpoints (`/api/*`), not MCP tools. These were legacy wrappers created during early dashboard development that bloated context without providing value for AI assistant integration.

**Impact:**
- ✅ **MCP tools**: 31.4k → 26.8k tokens (15% reduction, -4.6k tokens saved)
- ✅ **Zero functional impact**: Core memory tools preserved (`check_database_health`, `recall_memory`, etc.)
- ✅ **Cleaner separation**: MCP protocol for Claude Code integration, HTTP REST API for web dashboard

**Files Modified:**
- `src/mcp_memory_service/server.py`: Removed 8 tool definitions, call_tool handlers, and method implementations (~506 lines)
- `docs/api/tag-standardization.md`: Updated to use `check_database_health()` instead of `dashboard_get_stats()`
- `docs/maintenance/memory-maintenance.md`: Removed redundant dashboard tool reference
- `docs/guides/mcp-enhancements.md`: Removed `dashboard_optimize_db` progress tracking example
- `docs/assets/images/project-infographic.svg`: Removed `dashboard_*_ops` visual reference

**Note:** Web dashboard at `https://localhost:8443` continues working normally via REST API. No user-facing changes.

## [8.4.0] - 2025-10-08

### ✨ **Features & Improvements**

#### **Claude Code Memory Hooks Recency Optimization**
- **Problem Solved**: Memory hooks were surfacing 60+ day old memories instead of recent development work (Oct v8.0-v8.3), causing critical development context to be missing despite being stored in the database
- **Core Enhancement**: Comprehensive recency optimization with rebalanced scoring algorithm to prioritize recent memories over well-tagged old content

##### **Scoring Algorithm Improvements**
- **Weight Rebalancing** (`config.json`):
  - `timeDecay`: 0.25 → 0.40 (+60% influence on recency)
  - `tagRelevance`: 0.35 → 0.25 (-29% to reduce tag dominance)
  - `contentQuality`: 0.25 → 0.20 (-20% to balance with time)
- **Gentler Time Decay**:
  - `timeDecayRate`: 0.1 → 0.05 (30-day memories: 0.22 vs 0.05 score - preserves older memories)
- **Stronger Git Context**:
  - `gitContextWeight`: 1.2 → 1.8 (80% boost vs 20% for git-derived memories)
  - Implemented multiplication in `session-start.js` after scoring
- **Expanded Time Windows**:
  - `recentTimeWindow`: "last-week" → "last-month" (broader recent search)
  - `fallbackTimeWindow`: "last-month" → "last-3-months" (wider fallback range)
- **Higher Quality Bar**: `minRelevanceScore`: 0.3 → 0.4 (filters generic old content)

##### **New Recency Bonus System** (`memory-scorer.js`)
- **Tiered Additive Bonuses**:
  - < 7 days: +0.15 bonus (strong boost for last week)
  - < 14 days: +0.10 bonus (moderate boost for last 2 weeks)
  - < 30 days: +0.05 bonus (small boost for last month)
- **Implementation**: Configurable tier-based system using `RECENCY_TIERS` array
- **Impact**: Ensures recent memories always get advantage regardless of tag relevance

##### **Documentation & Testing**
- **Added**: Comprehensive `CONFIGURATION.md` (450+ lines)
  - All scoring weights with impact analysis
  - Time decay behavior and examples
  - Git context weight strategy
  - Recency bonus system documentation
  - Tuning guide for different workflows
  - Migration notes from v1.0
- **Added**: Validation test suite (`test-recency-scoring.js`)
  - Tests scoring algorithm with memories of different ages
  - Validates time decay and recency bonus calculations
  - Confirms recent memories rank higher (success criteria: 2 of top 3 < 7 days old)

##### **Results**
- **Before**: Top 3 memories averaged 45+ days old (July-Sept content)
- **After**: All top 3 memories < 7 days old ✅
- **Validation**: 80% higher likelihood of surfacing recent work

**Impact**: ✅ Memory hooks now reliably surface recent development context, significantly improving Claude Code session awareness for active projects

##### **Technical Details**
- **PR**: [#155](https://github.com/doobidoo/mcp-memory-service/pull/155) - Memory hooks recency optimization
- **Files Modified**:
  - Configuration: `claude-hooks/config.json` (scoring weights, time windows, git context)
  - Scoring: `claude-hooks/utilities/memory-scorer.js` (recency bonus, configurable decay)
  - Session: `claude-hooks/core/session-start.js` (git context weight implementation)
  - Tests: `claude-hooks/test-recency-scoring.js` (validation suite)
  - Documentation: `claude-hooks/CONFIGURATION.md` (comprehensive guide)
- **Code Review**: 7 rounds of Gemini Code Assist review completed
  - **CRITICAL bugs fixed**: Config values not being used (round 5), gitContextWeight not implemented (round 6)
  - **Security fixes**: TLS certificate validation, future timestamp handling
  - **Maintainability**: DRY refactoring, tier-based configuration, comprehensive docs
- **Test Results**: ✅ All validation checks passed - recent memories consistently prioritized

## [8.3.1] - 2025-10-07

### ✨ **Features & Improvements**

#### **HTTP Server Management Tools**
- **Added**: Cross-platform HTTP server management utilities for Claude Code Natural Memory Triggers
- **New Scripts**:

## [8.3.0] - 2025-10-07

### 🧹 **Refactoring & Code Cleanup**

#### **Complete ChromaDB Backend Removal**
- **Removed**: ~300-500 lines of ChromaDB dead code following v8.0.0 deprecation
- **Scope**: Complete cleanup across 18 files including configuration, CLI, server, storage, utilities, and web interface
- **Changes**:
  - **Configuration** (`config.py`): Removed CHROMA_PATH, CHROMA_SETTINGS, COLLECTION_METADATA, CHROMADB_MAX_CONTENT_LENGTH
  - **CLI** (`cli/main.py`, `cli/ingestion.py`): Removed `--chroma-path` option, removed 'chromadb' from storage backend choices
  - **Server** (`server.py`): Removed ChromaDB initialization (~60 lines), stats fallback (~40 lines), backup handler, validation logic
  - **Utilities** (`utils/db_utils.py`): Removed ChromaDB validation, stats, and repair functions (~140 lines)
  - **Storage** (`storage/cloudflare.py`, `storage/sqlite_vec.py`): Updated docstrings to be backend-agnostic
  - **Web** (`web/app.py`): Removed 'chromadb' from backend display name mapping
  - **Documentation**: Updated all error messages to suggest Cloudflare instead of ChromaDB
- **Impact**: ✅ Cleaner codebase, reduced technical debt, no misleading ChromaDB references
- **SUPPORTED_BACKENDS**: Now correctly shows `['sqlite_vec', 'sqlite-vec', 'cloudflare', 'hybrid']`

#### **CLI Backend Consistency Enhancement**
- **Added**: 'sqlite-vec' hyphenated alias to all CLI storage backend choices
- **Affected commands**: `server`, `status`, `ingest_document`, `ingest_directory`
- **Rationale**: Ensures CLI behavior matches SUPPORTED_BACKENDS configuration
- **Impact**: ✅ Improved user experience with consistent backend naming across CLI and configuration

### 🐛 **Bug Fixes**

#### **Dashboard System Information Display (Issue #151)**
- **Fixed**: Dashboard showing "N/A" for embedding model, embedding dimensions, and database size on non-hybrid backends
- **Root cause**: JavaScript expected hybrid-backend-specific nested paths (`storage.primary_stats.*`)
- **Solution**: Added fallback paths in `app.js` SYSTEM_INFO_CONFIG:
  - `settingsEmbeddingModel`: Falls back to `storage.embedding_model`
  - `settingsEmbeddingDim`: Falls back to `storage.embedding_dimension`
  - `settingsDbSize`: Falls back to `storage.database_size_mb`
- **Impact**: ✅ Dashboard now correctly displays system information for sqlite-vec, cloudflare, and hybrid backends

##### **Technical Details**
- **PR**: [#153](https://github.com/doobidoo/mcp-memory-service/pull/153) - ChromaDB dead code removal + Issue #151 fix
- **Files Modified**: 18 files
  - Core cleanup: `config.py`, `server.py`, `mcp_server.py`, `utils/db_utils.py`

## [8.2.4] - 2025-10-06

### 🐛 **Bug Fixes**

#### **Critical: Memory Hooks JSON Parsing Failure**
- **Fixed**: Memory awareness hooks completely broken - unable to retrieve memories due to JSON parsing errors
- **Root cause**: Naive string replacement in HTTP client destroyed valid JSON
  - `replace(/'/g, '"')` broke apostrophes in content (e.g., "it's" → "it"s")
  - Replaced Python-style values (True/False/None) in already-valid JSON
  - Used `/mcp` MCP-over-HTTP bridge instead of direct REST API
- **Solution**:
  - Removed destructive string replacements
  - Updated to use direct REST API endpoints (`/api/search`, `/api/search/by-time`)
  - Parse JSON responses directly without conversion
- **Impact**: ✅ Memory hooks now successfully retrieve context-relevant memories at session start

#### **HTTP Server Backend Configuration Override**
- **Fixed**: HTTP server ignored `.env` configuration, forcing `sqlite_vec` instead of configured `hybrid` backend
- **Root cause**: `run_http_server.py` used `os.environ.setdefault()` after `.env` loading, overriding user config
- **Solution**: Commented out the backend override line to respect `.env` settings
- **Impact**: ✅ Hybrid backend now works correctly via HTTP server

##### **Technical Details**
- **Files**:
  - `C:\Users\heinrich.krupp\.claude\hooks\utilities\memory-client.js` - Fixed `queryMemoriesHTTP()` method
  - `scripts/server/run_http_server.py` - Removed backend configuration override (line 148)
- **Affected**: All users using memory hooks with HTTP protocol (automatic session awareness)

## [8.2.3] - 2025-10-05

### ✨ **Enhancements**

#### **Dashboard Footer Navigation**
- **Added**: Comprehensive footer to dashboard with three sections

  - **About**: Project description, Apache 2.0 license link, copyright notice
- **Features**: Security attributes (target="_blank", rel="noopener"), responsive design (mobile breakpoint 768px)
- **Impact**: ✅ Improved discoverability of documentation and resources from dashboard

### 🐛 **Bug Fixes**

#### **Dark Mode Footer Styling**
- **Critical fix**: Footer appearing bright/light in dark mode instead of dark
- **Root cause**: Incorrect CSS variable usage - using wrong end of inverted color scale
  - Background used `var(--neutral-900)` (#f9fafb - light) instead of `var(--neutral-100)` (#1f2937 - dark)
  - Headings used `var(--neutral-100)` (dark text) instead of `var(--neutral-900)` (light text)
- **Solution**: Corrected CSS variables to match dashboard card pattern with !important flags
- **Impact**: ✅ Footer now properly displays with dark background and light text in dark mode

##### **Technical Details**
- **Files**:
  - `src/mcp_memory_service/web/static/index.html` - Footer HTML structure (lines 463-517)
  - `src/mcp_memory_service/web/static/style.css` - Footer styling and dark mode overrides (lines 1757-1893)

## [8.2.2] - 2025-10-05

### ✨ **Enhancements**

#### **HTTP-MCP Bridge: recall_memory Tool Support**
- **Added**: `recall_memory` tool to MCP HTTP bridge API
- **Functionality**: Natural language time-based memory retrieval (e.g., "last week", "yesterday")
- **Integration**: Seamlessly maps to storage backend's `recall_memory` method
- **API**: Accepts `query` (natural language) and optional `n_results` parameter
- **Use Case**: Enables time-aware memory recall through HTTP/MCP bridge interface

##### **Technical Details**
- **File**: `src/mcp_memory_service/web/api/mcp.py`
  - Added `recall_memory` tool definition to `MCP_TOOLS` array
  - Implemented handler in `handle_tool_call()` function
  - Returns standardized format: content, content_hash, tags, created_at

## [8.2.1] - 2025-10-05

### 🐛 **Bug Fixes**

#### **Critical: Missing Core Dependencies**
- **Fixed**: `sentence-transformers` and `torch` moved from optional `[ml]` extras to base dependencies
- **Root cause**: v8.2.0 removed ChromaDB but accidentally made semantic search dependencies optional
- **Impact**: Service failed to start with `ImportError: sentence-transformers is not available`
- **Resolution**: These are core dependencies required for semantic memory functionality
- **Breaking**: Users upgrading from v8.2.0 must run `uv sync` to install corrected dependencies

##### **Technical Details**
- **File**: `pyproject.toml`
  - Moved `sentence-transformers>=2.2.2` from `[ml]` to `dependencies`
  - Moved `torch>=2.0.0` from `[ml]` to `dependencies`
  - Semantic search is core functionality, not optional

- **Impact**: ✅ All dashboard elements now fully support dark mode without visual glitches

#### **Browse Tab User Experience**
- **Enhancement**: Automatic smooth scroll to results when clicking a tag
- **Implementation**: Added `scrollIntoView()` with smooth behavior to `filterByTag()` method
- **User Benefit**: No more manual scrolling needed - tag selection immediately shows filtered memories
- **Impact**: ✅ Significantly improved discoverability and flow in Browse by Tags view

##### **Technical Details**
- **File**: `src/mcp_memory_service/web/static/style.css`
  - Added dark mode override for connection status background, border, and text colors
  - Uses CSS variables for consistency with theme system
- **File**: `src/mcp_memory_service/web/static/app.js`
  - Added smooth scroll animation when displaying tag-filtered results
  - Scrolls results section into view with `block: 'start'` positioning

## [8.1.2] - 2025-10-05

### 🐛 **Bug Fixes**

#### **Dashboard Statistics Display**
- **Critical fix**: Dashboard showing 0 for "This Week" and "Tags" statistics on Hybrid and Cloudflare backends
- **Root cause**: Statistics fields not exposed at top level of storage health response

##### **Hybrid Backend Fix** (`src/mcp_memory_service/storage/hybrid.py`)
- Extract `unique_tags` from `primary_stats` to top-level stats dictionary
- Extract `memories_this_week` from `primary_stats` to top-level stats dictionary
- Maintains consistency with SQLite-vec standalone backend behavior

##### **Cloudflare Backend Fix** (`src/mcp_memory_service/storage/cloudflare.py`)
- Added SQL subquery to calculate `unique_tags` from tags table
- Added SQL subquery to calculate `memories_this_week` (last 7 days)
- Now returns both statistics in `get_stats()` response

##### **Impact**
- ✅ Dashboard now correctly displays weekly memory count for all backends
- ✅ Dashboard now correctly displays unique tags count for all backends
- ✅ SQLite-vec standalone backend already had these fields (no change needed)
- ✅ Fixes issue where hybrid/cloudflare users saw "0" despite having memories and tags

## [8.1.1] - 2025-10-05

### 🐛 **Bug Fixes**

#### **Dark Mode Text Contrast Regression**
- **Critical fix**: Memory card text barely visible in dark mode due to hardcoded white backgrounds
- **Root cause**: CSS variable redefinition made text colors too faint when applied to white backgrounds
- **Solution**: Override all major containers with dark backgrounds (`#1f2937`) and force bright text colors

##### **Fixed Components**
- Memory cards: Now use dark card backgrounds with bright white text (`#f9fafb`)
- Memory metadata: Labels bright white (`#f9fafb`), values light gray (`#d1d5db`)
- Action cards: Dark backgrounds for proper contrast
- All containers: App header, welcome card, search filters, modals now properly dark

##### **Technical Details**
- Added `!important` overrides for 11 container backgrounds
- Memory content text: `var(--neutral-900) !important` → `#f9fafb`
- Memory meta labels: `var(--neutral-900) !important` → `#f9fafb`
- Memory meta values: `var(--neutral-600) !important` → `#d1d5db`
- Cache-busting comments to force browser reload

##### **Impact**
- ✅ Dark mode now fully readable across all dashboard views
- ✅ Proper contrast ratios for accessibility
- ✅ No visual regression from v8.1.0 light mode

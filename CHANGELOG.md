## [Unreleased]

## [8.48.0] - 2025-12-07

### Added
- **CSV-Based Metadata Compression** - Intelligent metadata compression system for Cloudflare sync operations
  - Implemented CSV encoding/decoding for quality and consolidation metadata
  - Achieved 78% size reduction (732B → 159B typical case)
  - Provider code mapping (onnx_local → ox, groq_llama3_70b → gp, etc.) for 70% reduction in provider field
  - Metadata size validation (<9.5KB) prevents sync failures before Cloudflare API calls
  - Transparent compression/decompression in hybrid backend operations
  - Quality metadata optimizations:
    - ai_scores history limited to 3 most recent entries (10 → 3)
    - quality_components removed from sync (debug-only, reconstructible)
    - Cloudflare-specific field suppression (metadata_source, last_quality_check)
  - Location: `src/mcp_memory_service/quality/metadata_codec.py`

- **Verification Script** - Shell script to verify compression effectiveness
  - Tests CSV encoding/decoding round-trip accuracy
  - Measures compression ratios
  - Validates metadata size under Cloudflare limits
  - Location: `verify_compression.sh`

### Fixed
- **Cloudflare Sync Failures** - Resolved 100% of metadata size limit errors
  - Problem: Cloudflare D1 10KB metadata limit was exceeded by quality/consolidation metadata
  - Impact: 1 operation stuck in retry queue with 400 Bad Request errors
  - Root cause: Uncompressed metadata (ai_scores history, quality_components) exceeded limit
  - Solution: CSV compression + metadata size validation before sync
  - Result: 0 sync failures, all operations processing successfully
  - Locations: `src/mcp_memory_service/storage/hybrid.py` (lines 547-559, 77-119), `src/mcp_memory_service/storage/cloudflare.py` (lines 606-612, 741-747, 830-836, 1474-1480)

### Technical Details
- **Compression Architecture**: Phase 1 of 3-phase metadata optimization plan
  - Phase 1 (COMPLETE): CSV-based compression for quality/consolidation metadata
  - Phase 2 (AVAILABLE): Binary encoding with struct/msgpack (85-90% reduction target)
  - Phase 3 (AVAILABLE): Reference-based deduplication for repeated values
- **Backward Compatibility**: Fully transparent - automatic compression on write, decompression on read
- **Performance Impact**: Negligible (<1ms overhead per operation)
- **Testing**: All quality system tests passing, sync queue empty, 3,750 ONNX-scored memories verified

## [8.47.1] - 2025-12-07

### Fixed
- **ONNX Self-Match Bug** - ONNX bulk evaluation was using memory content as its own query, producing artificially inflated scores (~1.0 for all memories)
  - Root cause: Cross-encoder design requires meaningful query-memory pairs for relevance ranking
  - Fixed by generating queries from tags/metadata (what memory is *about*) instead of memory content
  - Result: Realistic quality distribution (avg 0.468 vs 1.000, breakdown: 42.9% high / 3.2% medium / 53.9% low)
  - Location: `scripts/quality/bulk_evaluate_onnx.py`

- **Association Pollution** - System-generated associations and compressed clusters were being evaluated for quality
  - These memories are structural (not content) and shouldn't receive quality scores
  - Fixed by filtering memories with type='association' or type='compressed_cluster'
  - Added belt-and-suspenders check for 'source_memory_hashes' metadata field
  - Impact: 948 system-generated memories excluded from evaluation
  - Location: `scripts/quality/bulk_evaluate_onnx.py`

- **Sync Queue Overflow** - Queue capacity of 1,000 was overwhelmed by 4,478 updates during bulk ONNX evaluation
  - Resulted in 278 Cloudflare sync failures (27.8% failure rate)
  - Fixed by increasing queue size to 2,000 (env: `MCP_HYBRID_QUEUE_SIZE`)
  - Fixed by increasing batch size to 100 (env: `MCP_HYBRID_BATCH_SIZE`)
  - Added 5-second timeout with fallback to immediate sync on queue full
  - Added `wait_for_sync_completion()` method for monitoring bulk operations
  - Result: 0% sync failure rate during bulk operations
  - Location: `src/mcp_memory_service/storage/hybrid.py`, `src/mcp_memory_service/config.py`

- **Consolidation Hang** - Batch update optimization was missing for relevance score updates
  - Sequential update_memory() calls caused slowdown during consolidation
  - Fixed by collecting updates and using single `update_memories_batch()` transaction
  - Impact: 50-100x speedup for relevance score updates during consolidation
  - Location: `src/mcp_memory_service/consolidation/consolidator.py`

### Added
- **Reset ONNX Scores Script** (`scripts/quality/reset_onnx_scores.py`)
  - Resets all ONNX quality scores to implicit defaults (0.5)
  - Pauses hybrid backend sync during reset, resumes after completion
  - Preserves timestamps (doesn't change created_at/updated_at)
  - Progress reporting every 500 memories
  - Use case: Recover from bad ONNX evaluation (self-match bug)

- **Enhanced Bulk Evaluate Script** (`scripts/quality/bulk_evaluate_onnx.py`)
  - Added association filtering (skip system-generated memories)
  - Added sync monitoring with queue size reporting
  - Added wait_for_sync_completion() call to prevent premature exit
  - Enhanced progress reporting with sync stats
  - Proper pause/resume for hybrid backend sync

### Changed
- **ONNX Configuration Defaults** - Updated for better bulk operation support
  - `HYBRID_QUEUE_SIZE`: 1,000 → 2,000 (default, configurable via env)
  - `HYBRID_BATCH_SIZE`: 50 → 100 (default, configurable via env)
  - Backward compatible: `HYBRID_MAX_QUEUE_SIZE` still supported (legacy)

- **Hybrid Backend Sync** - Enhanced pause/resume state tracking
  - Added `_sync_paused` flag to prevent enqueuing during pause (v8.47.1)
  - Fixed race condition where operations were enqueued while sync was paused
  - Ensures operations are not lost during consolidation or bulk updates

### Documentation
- **ONNX Limitations** - Added critical warning to CLAUDE.md
  - Documented that ONNX ranker (ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2) is a cross-encoder
  - Clarified it scores query-memory relevance, not absolute quality
  - Explained why self-matching queries produce artificially high scores
  - Added system-generated memory exclusion rationale

## [8.47.0] - 2025-12-06

### Added
- **Association-Based Quality Boost** - Memories with many connections automatically receive quality score boosts during consolidation
  - Well-connected memories (≥5 connections by default) get 20% quality boost
  - Leverages network effect: frequently referenced memories are likely more valuable
  - Configurable via environment variables: `MCP_CONSOLIDATION_QUALITY_BOOST_ENABLED`, `MCP_CONSOLIDATION_MIN_CONNECTIONS_FOR_BOOST`, `MCP_CONSOLIDATION_QUALITY_BOOST_FACTOR`
  - Valid boost factor range: 1.0-2.0 (default: 1.2 = 20% boost)
  - Quality scores capped at 1.0 to prevent over-promotion
  - Full metadata persistence with audit trail (connection count, original scores, boost date, boost reason)
  - Impact: Boosted quality affects relevance scoring (~4% increase) and retention tier (can move from medium to high retention)
  - Location: `src/mcp_memory_service/consolidation/decay.py`

- **Quality Boost Metadata Tracking** - Complete audit trail for all quality boosts applied during consolidation
  - `quality_boost_applied`: Boolean flag indicating boost was applied
  - `quality_boost_date`: ISO timestamp of when boost occurred
  - `quality_boost_reason`: Always "association_connections" for this release
  - `quality_boost_connection_count`: Number of connections that triggered the boost
  - `original_quality_before_boost`: Preserved original quality score for analysis

- **Configuration Variables** - Three new environment variables with validation
  - `MCP_CONSOLIDATION_QUALITY_BOOST_ENABLED` (default: true) - Master toggle
  - `MCP_CONSOLIDATION_MIN_CONNECTIONS_FOR_BOOST` (default: 5, range: 1-100) - Minimum connections required
  - `MCP_CONSOLIDATION_QUALITY_BOOST_FACTOR` (default: 1.2, range: 1.0-2.0) - Boost multiplier

### Changed
- **Exponential Decay Calculation** - Enhanced to include association-based quality boost
  - Quality boost applied before quality multiplier calculation
  - Debug logging for each boost application
  - Info logging when persisting boosted scores to memory metadata
  - Preserved original quality score in RelevanceScore metadata for comparison

- **Memory Relevance Metadata** - Extended to include quality boost tracking
  - `update_memory_relevance_metadata()` now persists boosted quality scores
  - Automatic quality score update if boost was applied
  - Metadata fields added: `quality_boost_applied`, `quality_boost_date`, `quality_boost_reason`, etc.

### Documentation
- Added comprehensive feature guide: `docs/features/association-quality-boost.md`
  - Configuration examples (conservative, balanced, aggressive)
  - Impact on memory lifecycle (relevance, retention, forgetting resistance)
  - Use cases (knowledge graphs, code documentation, research notes)
  - Monitoring and troubleshooting guides
  - Performance impact analysis (negligible computational cost)
  - Future enhancement roadmap (connection quality analysis, temporal decay, bidirectional boost)

- Updated `CLAUDE.md` with v8.47.0 release information
  - Added association-based quality boost to consolidation features list
  - Added configuration examples with environment variables
  - Updated version summary at top of file

### Tests
- Added 5 comprehensive test cases in `tests/consolidation/test_decay.py`
  - `test_association_quality_boost_enabled`: Validates boost increases scores
  - `test_association_quality_boost_threshold`: Confirms minimum connection enforcement
  - `test_association_quality_boost_caps_at_one`: Verifies quality cap at 1.0
  - `test_association_quality_boost_disabled`: Tests feature disable functionality
  - `test_association_quality_boost_persists_to_memory`: Validates metadata persistence
  - All tests use monkeypatch for configuration override
  - 100% test pass rate (5/5 new tests, 17/18 total consolidation tests)

### Technical Details
- Feature enabled by default to provide immediate value
- Boost calculation time: ~5-10 microseconds per memory (negligible overhead)
- Memory overhead: ~200 bytes per boosted memory (5 metadata fields)
- No measurable impact on consolidation duration
- Integration point: `ExponentialDecayCalculator._calculate_memory_relevance()`
- Quality boost applied BEFORE quality multiplier calculation in relevance scoring
- Boost only applied if: enabled, connection count ≥ threshold, boost would increase score
- Future-proof: `MCP_CONSOLIDATION_MIN_CONNECTED_QUALITY` reserved for Phase 2 (connection quality analysis)

## [8.46.3] - 2025-12-06

### Fixed
- **Quality Score Persistence in Hybrid Backend** - Fixed ONNX quality scores not persisting to Cloudflare in hybrid storage backend
  - Scores remained at default 0.5 instead of evaluated ~1.0 values
  - Root cause: `/api/quality/evaluate` endpoint was passing entire `memory.metadata` dict to `update_memory_metadata()`
  - Cloudflare backend expects quality fields wrapped in 'metadata' key, not as top-level fields

- **Metadata Normalization for Cloudflare** - Added `_normalize_metadata_for_cloudflare()` helper function
  - Separates Cloudflare-recognized top-level keys (metadata, memory_type, tags, timestamps) from custom metadata fields
  - Wraps custom fields in 'metadata' key as expected by Cloudflare D1 backend
  - Only wraps if not already wrapped (idempotent operation)

- **Quality API Metadata Handling** - Modified `/api/quality/evaluate` endpoint to extract only quality-related fields
  - Now passes only: quality_score, quality_provider, ai_scores, quality_components
  - Prevents accidental metadata overwrites from passing entire metadata dict
  - Added detailed logging for troubleshooting persistence issues

- **Hybrid Backend Sync Operation** - Enhanced `SyncOperation` dataclass with `preserve_timestamps` flag
  - Ensures timestamp preservation through background sync queue
  - Passes flag to Cloudflare backend during update operations
  - Maintains temporal consistency across hybrid backends

### Technical Details
- Affects only hybrid backend with Cloudflare secondary storage
- SQLite-vec primary storage was working correctly (scores persisted locally)
- Issue manifested during background sync to Cloudflare D1
- Verification: Search results now show quality scores of 1.000 instead of 0.500

## [8.46.2] - 2025-12-06

### Fixed
- **Session-Start Hook Crash** - Added missing `queryMemoriesByTagsAndTime()` function to HTTP memory client
  - Hook was calling undefined function, causing "is not a function" error on session start
  - Implemented client-side tag filtering on time-based search results
  - Works with both HTTP and MCP protocols
  - Enables users to use session-start hooks without crashes

- **Hook Installer Warnings Eliminated** - Removed confusing package import warnings during installation
  - Created `_version.py` to isolate version metadata from main package
  - Updated `install_hooks.py` to read version from `pyproject.toml` (avoids heavy imports)
  - Warnings appeared because importing `mcp_memory_service` loaded sqlite-vec/sentence_transformers dependencies
  - Provides clean installation experience without misleading warnings

### Technical Details
- Root cause (session-start): `memory-client.js` missing function implementation for combined tag+time queries
- Root cause (installer warnings): Hook installer imported main package for version detection, triggering model initialization warnings
- Fix applies to all platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux)

## [8.46.1] - 2025-12-06

### Fixed
- **Windows Hooks Installer Encoding** - Fixed `'charmap' codec can't encode character` error when running `install_hooks.py` on Windows
  - Added UTF-8 console configuration (CP65001) at script startup
  - Reconfigured stdout/stderr with `encoding='utf-8', errors='replace'`
  - Added explicit `encoding='utf-8'` to all JSON file read/write operations
  - Added `ensure_ascii=False` to `json.dump()` for proper Unicode handling

### Technical Details
- Root cause: Windows console default encoding (CP1252) doesn't support Unicode emojis (✅, ⚠️, etc.)
- Fix applies to all Windows systems regardless of console code page setting

## [8.46.0] - 2025-12-06

### Added
- **Quality System + Hooks Integration** - Complete 3-phase integration of AI quality scoring into memory awareness hooks:
  - **Phase 1**: Hooks read `backendQuality` from memory metadata (20% weight in scoring)
  - **Phase 2**: Session-end hook triggers async `/api/quality/memories/{hash}/evaluate` endpoint
  - **Phase 3**: Quality-boosted search with `quality_boost` and `quality_weight` parameters

- **`POST /api/quality/memories/{hash}/evaluate`** - New endpoint to trigger AI-based quality evaluation
  - Uses multi-tier system (ONNX local → Groq → Gemini → Implicit)
  - Returns quality_score, quality_provider, ai_score, evaluation_time_ms
  - Performance: ~355ms with ONNX ranker

- **Quality-Boosted Search** - Added `quality_boost` and `quality_weight` to `/api/search`
  - Over-fetches 3x results, reranks with composite score
  - Formula: `(1-weight)*semantic + weight*quality`
  - Returns `search_type: "semantic_quality_boost"` with score breakdown

- **Hook Integration Functions**
  - `calculateBackendQuality()` in `memory-scorer.js` extracts quality_score from metadata
  - `triggerQualityEvaluation()` in `session-end.js` for async scoring
  - `queryMemories()` in `memory-client.js` supports `qualityBoost` option

### Changed
- Updated hook scoring weights: timeDecay (20%), tagRelevance (30%), contentRelevance (10%), contentQuality (20%), backendQuality (20%)

### Technical Details
- Hook evaluation: Non-blocking with 10s timeout, graceful fallback on failure
- Requires Memory Quality System (v8.45.0+) to be enabled

## [8.45.3] - 2025-12-06

### Fixed
- **ONNX Ranker Model Export** - Fixed broken model download URL (404 from HuggingFace) by implementing automatic model export from transformers to ONNX format on first use
- **Offline Mode Support** - Added `local_files_only=True` support for air-gapped/offline environments using cached HuggingFace models
- **Tokenizer Loading** - Fixed tokenizer initialization to load from exported pretrained files instead of broken archive

### Changed
- Replaced failing `onnx.tar.gz` download approach with dynamic export from `cross-encoder/ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2` via transformers
- Model now exports to `~/.cache/mcp_memory/onnx_models/ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2/model.onnx` on first initialization
- Added graceful fallback: tries `local_files_only` first, then online download if not cached

### Technical Details
- Performance: 7-16ms per memory scoring on CPU (CPUExecutionProvider)
- Model size: ~23MB exported ONNX model
- Dependencies: Requires `transformers`, `torch`, `onnxruntime`, `onnx` packages

### Changed
- Enhanced `.view-btn` dark mode styles with proper hover states for better user interaction

## [8.45.1] - 2025-12-05

### Fixed
- **Quality System HTTP API** - Fixed router configuration causing 404 errors on all `/api/quality/*` endpoints (missing `/api/quality` prefix in app.py router inclusion)
- **Quality Distribution MCP Tool** - Corrected storage method call from non-existent `search_all_memories()` to `get_all_memories()` in server.py quality distribution handler
- **HTTP API Tests** - Replaced synchronous `TestClient` with async `httpx.AsyncClient` to fix SQLite thread safety issues in quality system tests
- **Distribution Endpoint** - Fixed storage retrieval logic in quality.py and removed unnecessary dict-to-Memory conversions

### Added

## [8.38.1] - 2025-11-26

### Fixed
- **HTTP MCP Transport: JSON-RPC 2.0 Compliance** - Fixed critical bug where HTTP MCP responses violated JSON-RPC 2.0 specification (PR #249, fixes #236)
  - **Problem**: FastAPI ignored Pydantic's `ConfigDict(exclude_none=True)` when directly returning models, causing responses to include null fields (`"error": null` in success, `"result": null` in errors)
  - **Impact**: Claude Code/Desktop rejected all HTTP MCP communications due to spec violation
  - **Solution**: Wrapped all `MCPResponse` returns in `JSONResponse` with explicit `.model_dump(exclude_none=True)` serialization

### Fixed
- **CRITICAL: Interval Aggregation Bug** - Multi-day intervals (weekly, monthly) now correctly aggregate across entire period
  - **Problem**: Intervals were only counting memories from the first day of the interval, not the entire period
  - **Impact**: Analytics showed wildly inaccurate data (e.g., 0 memories instead of 427 for Oct 24-30 week)
  - **Root Cause**: `strftime` format in date grouping only used the first timestamp, not the interval's date range
  - **Solution**: Updated aggregation logic to properly filter and count all memories within each interval
  - **Files Modified**: `src/mcp_memory_service/web/api/analytics.py` (lines 242-267)

- **CRITICAL: Data Sampling Bug** - Analytics now fetch complete historical data with proper date range filtering
  - **Problem**: API only fetched 1,000 most recent memories, missing historical data for longer time periods
  - **Impact**: Charts showed incomplete or missing data for older time ranges
  - **Solution**: Increased fetch limit to 10,000 memories with proper `created_at >= start_date` filtering
  - **Files Modified**: `src/mcp_memory_service/web/api/analytics.py` (lines 56-62)
  - **Performance**: Maintains fast response times (<200ms) even with larger dataset

### Changed
- **Analytics API**: Improved data fetching with larger limits and proper date filtering for accurate historical analysis

## [8.28.1] - 2025-11-22

### Fixed
- **CRITICAL: HTTP MCP Transport JSON-RPC 2.0 Compliance** - Fixed protocol violation causing Claude Code rejection (#236)
  - **Problem**: HTTP MCP server returned `"error": null` in successful responses, violating JSON-RPC 2.0 spec which requires successful responses to OMIT the error field entirely (not include it as null)
  - **Impact**: Claude Code's strict schema validation rejected all HTTP MCP responses with "Unrecognized key(s) in object: 'error'" errors, making HTTP transport completely unusable
  - **Root Cause**: MCPResponse Pydantic model included both `result` and `error` fields in all responses, serializing null values
  - **Solution**:
    - Added `ConfigDict(exclude_none=True)` to MCPResponse model to exclude null fields from serialization
    - Updated docstring to document JSON-RPC 2.0 compliance requirements
    - Replaced deprecated `.dict()` with `.model_dump()` for Pydantic V2 compatibility
    - Moved json import to top of file per PEP 8 style guidelines
  - **Files Modified**:
    - `src/mcp_memory_service/web/api/mcp.py` - Added ConfigDict, updated serialization
  - **Affected Users**: All users attempting to use HTTP MCP transport with Claude Code or other strict JSON-RPC 2.0 clients
  - **Testing**: Verified successful responses exclude `error` field and error responses exclude `result` field
  - **Credits**: Thanks to @timkjr for identifying the issue and providing the fix

## [8.28.0] - 2025-11-21

### Added
- **Cloudflare Tag Filtering** - AND/OR operations for tag searches with unified API contracts (#228)
  - Added `search_by_tags(tags, operation, time_start, time_end)` to the storage base class and implemented it across SQLite, Cloudflare, Hybrid, and HTTP client backends
  - Normalized Cloudflare SQL to use `GROUP BY` + `HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT ...)` for AND semantics while supporting optional time ranges
  - Introduced `get_all_tags_with_counts()` for Cloudflare to power analytics dashboards without extra queries

### Changed
- **Tag Filtering Behavior** - `get_all_memories(tags=...)` now performs exact tag comparisons with AND logic instead of substring OR matching, and hybrid storage exposes the same `operation` parameter for parity across backends.

## [8.27.2] - 2025-11-18

### Fixed
- **Memory Type Loss During Cloudflare-to-SQLite Sync** - Fixed `memory_type` not being preserved in sync script
  - **Problem**: `scripts/sync/sync_memory_backends.py` did not extract or pass `memory_type` when syncing from Cloudflare to SQLite-vec
  - **Impact**: All memories synced via `--direction cf-to-sqlite` showed as "untyped" (100%) in dashboard analytics
  - **Root Cause**: Missing `memory_type` field in both memory dict extraction and Memory object creation
  - **Solution**:
    - Added `memory_type` to memory dictionary extraction from source
    - Added `memory_type` and `updated_at` parameters when creating Memory objects for target storage
  - **Files Modified**:
    - `scripts/sync/sync_memory_backends.py` - Added memory_type and updated_at handling
  - **Affected Users**: Users who ran `python scripts/sync/sync_memory_backends.py --direction cf-to-sqlite`
  - **Recovery**: Re-run sync from Cloudflare to restore memory types (Cloudflare preserves original types)

## [8.27.1] - 2025-11-18

### Fixed
- **CRITICAL: Timestamp Regression Bug** - Fixed `created_at` timestamps being reset during metadata sync
  - **Problem**: Bidirectional sync and drift detection (v8.25.0-v8.27.0) incorrectly reset `created_at` timestamps to current time during metadata updates
  - **Impact**: All memories synced from Cloudflare → SQLite-vec appeared "just created", destroying historical timestamp data
  - **Root Cause**: `preserve_timestamps=False` parameter reset **both** `created_at` and `updated_at`, when it should only update `updated_at`
  - **Solution**:
    - Modified `update_memory_metadata()` to preserve `created_at` from source memory during sync
    - Hybrid storage now passes all 4 timestamp fields (`created_at`, `created_at_iso`, `updated_at`, `updated_at_iso`) during drift detection
    - Cloudflare storage updated to handle timestamps consistently with SQLite-vec
  - **Files Modified**:
    - `src/mcp_memory_service/storage/sqlite_vec.py:1389-1406` - Fixed timestamp handling logic
    - `src/mcp_memory_service/storage/hybrid.py:625-637, 935-947` - Pass source timestamps during sync
    - `src/mcp_memory_service/storage/cloudflare.py:833-864` - Consistent timestamp handling
  - **Tests Added**: `tests/test_timestamp_preservation.py` - Comprehensive test suite with 7 tests covering:
    - Timestamp preservation with `preserve_timestamps=True`
    - Regression test for `created_at` preservation without source timestamps
    - Drift detection scenario
    - Multiple sync operations
    - Initial memory storage
  - **Recovery Tools**:
    - `scripts/validation/validate_timestamp_integrity.py` - Detect timestamp anomalies
    - `scripts/maintenance/recover_timestamps_from_cloudflare.py` - Restore corrupted timestamps from Cloudflare
  - **Affected Versions**: v8.25.0 (drift detection), v8.27.0 (bidirectional sync)
  - **Affected Users**: Hybrid backend users who experienced automatic drift detection or initial sync
  - **Data Recovery**: If using hybrid backend and Cloudflare has correct timestamps, run recovery script:
    ```bash
    # Preview recovery
    python scripts/maintenance/recover_timestamps_from_cloudflare.py --dry-run

    # Apply recovery
    python scripts/maintenance/recover_timestamps_from_cloudflare.py --apply
    ```

### Changed
- **Timestamp Handling Semantics** - Clarified `preserve_timestamps` parameter behavior:
  - `preserve_timestamps=True` (default): Only updates `updated_at` to current time, preserves `created_at`
  - `preserve_timestamps=False`: Uses timestamps from `updates` dict if provided, otherwise preserves existing `created_at`
  - **Never** resets `created_at` to current time (this was the bug)

### Added
- **Timestamp Integrity Validation** - New script to detect timestamp anomalies:
  ```bash
  python scripts/validation/validate_timestamp_integrity.py
  ```
  - Checks for impossible timestamps (`created_at > updated_at`)
  - Detects suspicious timestamp clusters (bulk reset indicators)
  - Analyzes timestamp distribution for anomalies
  - Provides detailed statistics and warnings

## [8.27.0] - 2025-11-17

### Added
- **Hybrid Storage Sync Performance Optimization** - Dramatic initial sync speed improvement (3-5x faster)
  - **Performance Metrics**:
    - **Before**: ~5.5 memories/second (8 minutes for 2,619 memories)
    - **After**: ~15-30 memories/second (1.5-3 minutes for 2,619 memories)
    - **3-5x faster** initial sync from Cloudflare to local SQLite
  - **Optimizations**:
    - **Bulk Existence Check**: `get_all_content_hashes()` method eliminates 2,619 individual DB queries
    - **Parallel Processing**: `asyncio.gather()` with Semaphore(15) for concurrent memory processing
    - **Larger Batch Sizes**: Increased from 100 to 500 memories per Cloudflare API call (5x fewer requests)
  - **Files Modified**:
    - `src/mcp_memory_service/storage/sqlite_vec.py` - Added `get_all_content_hashes()` method (lines 1208-1227)
    - `src/mcp_memory_service/storage/hybrid.py` - Parallel sync implementation (lines 859-921)
    - `scripts/benchmarks/benchmark_hybrid_sync.py` - Performance validation script
  - **Backward Compatibility**: Zero breaking changes, transparent optimization for all sync operations
  - **Use Case**: Users with large memory databases (1000+ memories) will see significantly faster initial sync times

### Changed
- **Hybrid Initial Sync Architecture** - Refactored sync loop for better performance
  - O(1) hash lookups instead of O(n) individual queries
  - Concurrent processing with controlled parallelism (15 simultaneous operations)
  - Reduced Cloudflare API overhead with larger batches (6 API calls vs 27)
  - Maintains full drift detection and metadata synchronization capabilities

### Fixed
- **Duplicate Sync Queue Architecture** - Resolved inefficient dual-sync issue
  - **Problem**: MCP server and HTTP server each created separate HybridStorage instances with independent sync queues
  - **Impact**: Duplicate sync work, potential race conditions, memory not immediately visible across servers
  - **Solution**: New `MCP_HYBRID_SYNC_OWNER` configuration to control which process handles Cloudflare sync
  - **Configuration Options**:
    - `"http"` - HTTP server only handles sync (recommended - avoids duplicate work)
    - `"mcp"` - MCP server only handles sync
    - `"both"` - Both servers sync independently (default for backward compatibility)
  - **Files Modified**:
    - `src/mcp_memory_service/config.py` - Added `HYBRID_SYNC_OWNER` configuration (lines 424-427)
    - `src/mcp_memory_service/storage/factory.py` - Server-type aware storage creation (lines 76-110)
    - `src/mcp_memory_service/mcp_server.py` - Pass server_type="mcp" (line 143)
    - `src/mcp_memory_service/web/dependencies.py` - Pass server_type="http" (line 65)
  - **Migration Guide**:
    ```bash
    # Recommended: Set HTTP server as sync owner to eliminate duplicate sync
    export MCP_HYBRID_SYNC_OWNER=http
    ```
  - **Backward Compatibility**: Defaults to "both" (existing behavior), no breaking changes

### Performance
- **Benchmark Results** (`python scripts/benchmarks/benchmark_hybrid_sync.py`):
  - Bulk hash loading: 2,619 hashes loaded in ~100ms (vs ~13,000ms for individual queries)
  - Parallel processing: 15x concurrency reduces CPU idle time
  - Batch size optimization: 78% reduction in API calls (27 → 6 for 2,619 memories)
  - Combined speedup: 3-5x faster initial sync

  - **Impact**: No functional changes, pure code quality improvement
  - **File Modified**: `scripts/sync/check_drift.py`
  - **Credit**: Implements Gemini code review suggestions from PR #224

## [8.25.1] - 2025-11-16

### Fixed
- **Drift Detection Script Initialization** - Corrected critical bugs in `check_drift.py` (PR #224)
  - **Bug 1**: Fixed incorrect config attribute `SQLITE_DB_PATH` → `SQLITE_VEC_PATH` in AppConfig
  - **Bug 2**: Added missing `cloudflare_config` parameter to HybridMemoryStorage initialization
  - **Impact**: Script was completely broken for Cloudflare/Hybrid backends - now initializes successfully
  - **Error prevented**: `AttributeError: 'AppConfig' object has no attribute 'SQLITE_DB_PATH'`
  - **File Modified**: `scripts/sync/check_drift.py`
  - **Severity**: High - Script was non-functional for users with hybrid or cloudflare backends
- **CI Test Infrastructure** - Added HuggingFace model caching to prevent network-related test failures (PR #225)
  - **Root Cause**: GitHub Actions runners cannot access huggingface.co during test runs
  - **Solution**: Implemented `actions/cache@v3` for `~/.cache/huggingface` directory
  - **Pre-download step**: Downloads `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` model after dependency installation
  - **Impact**: Fixes all future PR test failures caused by model download restrictions
  - **Cache Strategy**: Key includes `pyproject.toml` hash for dependency tracking
  - **Performance**: First run downloads model, subsequent runs use cache
  - **File Modified**: `.github/workflows/main.yml`

### Technical Details
- **PR #224**: Drift detection script now properly initializes Cloudflare backend with all required parameters (api_token, account_id, d1_database_id, vectorize_index)
- **PR #225**: CI environment now caches embedding models, eliminating network dependency during test execution
- **Testing**: Both fixes validated in PR test runs - drift detection now works, tests pass consistently

- **Commit**: ffc6246 - refactor: code quality improvements from Gemini review (issue #180)

## [8.24.3] - 2025-11-15

### Fixed
- **GitHub Release Manager Agent** - Resolved systematic version history omission in README.md (commit ccf959a)
  - Fixed agent behavior that was omitting previous versions from "Previous Releases" section
  - Added v8.24.1 to Previous Releases list (was missing despite being valid release)
  - Enhanced agent instructions with CRITICAL section for maintaining version history integrity
  - Added quality assurance checklist item to prevent future omissions
  - Root cause: Agent was replacing entire Previous Releases section instead of prepending new version

### Added
- **Test Coverage for Tag+Time Filtering** - Comprehensive test suite for issue #216 (commit ebff282)
  - 10 unit tests passing across SQLite-vec, Cloudflare, and Hybrid backends
  - Validates PR #215 functionality (tag+time filtering to fix semantic over-filtering bug #214)
  - Tests verify memories can be retrieved using both tag criteria AND time range filters
  - API integration tests created (with known threading issues documented for future fix)

## [8.24.2] - 2025-11-15

### Fixed
- **CI/CD Workflow Infrastructure** - Development Setup Validation workflow fixes (issue #217 related)
  - Fixed bash errexit handling in workflow tests - prevents premature exit on intentional test failures
  - Corrected exit code capture using EXIT_CODE=0 and || EXIT_CODE=$? pattern
  - All 5 workflow tests now passing: version consistency, pre-commit hooks, server warnings, developer prompts, docs accuracy
  - Root cause: bash runs with -e flag (errexit), which exits immediately when commands return non-zero exit codes
  - Tests intentionally run check_dev_setup.py expecting exit code 1, but bash was exiting before capture
  - Commits: b4f9a5a, d1bcd67

### Changed
- Workflow tests can now properly validate that the development setup validator correctly detects problems
- Exit code capture no longer uses "|| true" pattern (was making all commands return 0)

### Technical Details
- **Files Modified**: .github/workflows/dev-setup-validation.yml
- **Pattern Change**:
  - Before: `python script.py || true` (always returns 0, breaks exit code testing)
  - After: `EXIT_CODE=0; python script.py || EXIT_CODE=$?` (captures actual exit code, prevents bash exit)
- **Test Jobs**: All 5 jobs in dev-setup-validation workflow now pass consistently
- **Context**: Part of test infrastructure improvement efforts (issue #217)

## [8.24.1] - 2025-11-15

### Fixed
- **Test Infrastructure Failures** - Resolved 27 pre-existing test failures (issue #217)

- **Execution Time**: ~15 minutes (vs 1-2 hours manual)
- **Files Modified**: 11 test files across tests/ and tests/integration/
- **Root Causes**: Test infrastructure issues, not code bugs
- **Remaining Failures**: 172 failures remain (backend config, performance, actual bugs)

## [8.24.0] - 2025-11-12

### Added
- **PyPI Publishing Automation** - Package now available via `pip install mcp-memory-service`
  - **Workflow Automation**: Configured GitHub Actions workflow to automatically publish to PyPI on tag pushes

- **For Existing Users**: No action required - git-based installation continues to work
- **For Contributors**: Tag creation now triggers PyPI publishing automatically

## [8.23.1] - 2025-11-10

### Fixed
- **Stale Virtual Environment Prevention System** - Comprehensive 6-layer strategy to prevent "stale venv vs source code" version mismatches
  - **Root Cause**: MCP servers load from site-packages, not source files. System restart doesn't help - it relaunches with same stale package
  - **Impact**: Prevented issue that caused v8.23.0 tag validation bug to persist despite v8.22.2 fix (source showed v8.23.0 while venv had v8.5.3)

### Added
- **Phase 1: Automated Detection**

    4. Interactive developer prompts
    5. Documentation accuracy checks

### Changed
- **Developer Workflow**: Developers now automatically guided to use `pip install -e .` for proper setup
- **Pre-commit Hook**: Now validates venv consistency before allowing commits
- **Installation Process**: Detects developer mode and provides targeted guidance

### Technical Details
- **6-Layer Prevention System**:
  1. **Development**: Pre-commit hook blocks bad commits, detection script validates setup
  2. **Runtime**: Server startup warnings catch edge cases
  3. **Documentation**: CLAUDE.md, README.md, ai-agent-instructions.md all updated
  4. **Automation**: check_dev_setup.py, pre-commit hook, CI/CD workflow
  5. **Interactive**: install.py prompts developers for editable install
  6. **Testing**: CI/CD workflow with 5 comprehensive test jobs

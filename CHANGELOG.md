# Changelog

**Recent releases for MCP Memory Service (v10.0.0 and later)**

All notable changes to the MCP Memory Service project will be documented in this file.

For older releases (v9.3.1 and earlier), see [docs/archive/CHANGELOG-HISTORIC.md](./docs/archive/CHANGELOG-HISTORIC.md).

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/), and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed
- **Config: replace raw `int(os.getenv())` with `safe_get_int_env()`**: Hybrid backend sync interval, batch size, queue size, retry count, health check interval, drift check interval, retention periods, and mDNS discovery timeout were parsed with raw `int()` which crashes on invalid input. Now use `safe_get_int_env()` and `safe_get_bool_env()` with sensible min/max bounds.

### Added
- **`validate_config()` function**: New cross-field validation callable at startup. Catches: HTTPS enabled without cert/key files, hybrid search weights not summing to 1.0 (with auto-normalization notice). Returns a list of issue strings; called at both MCP server and HTTP server startup. 8 new tests covering `safe_get_int_env` robustness and `validate_config` cross-field checks.

## [10.14.0] - 2026-02-18

### Added
- **`conversation_id` parameter for `memory_store` and REST API**: Pass `conversation_id` when storing memories from the same conversation to allow incremental saves without being blocked by semantic deduplication. Exact hash deduplication is always enforced. The `conversation_id` is stored in memory metadata for future retrieval/grouping. Applies to both the MCP `memory_store` tool and the `POST /api/memories` REST endpoint. Closes #463.

### Fixed
- **CI: update hash assertion in integration test**: `test_store_memory_success` was asserting `"..." in text` (truncated hash), but commit `978af00` intentionally changed responses to show the full 64-character content hash. Updated assertion to `re.search(r'[0-9a-f]{64}', text)` to match current behaviour.

## [10.13.2] - 2026-02-17

### Fixed
- **HybridMemoryStorage missing StorageProtocol proxy methods**: Added `delete_memory()`, `get_memory_connections()`, and `get_access_patterns()` proxy methods that delegate to the primary SQLite backend, matching the interface expected by `DreamInspiredConsolidator`. Without these, the consolidation forgetting phase silently failed when using hybrid storage (#471, thanks @VibeCodeChef)
- **Timezone-aware datetime comparison TypeError**: Replaced `datetime.utcfromtimestamp()` (which creates naive datetimes) with `datetime.fromtimestamp(x, tz=timezone.utc)` throughout the consolidation module. Comparisons between naive `Memory.timestamp` values and timezone-aware `datetime.now(timezone.utc)` were crashing quarterly/yearly consolidation runs. Fixed in `consolidation/base.py`, `consolidation/clustering.py`, `consolidation/forgetting.py`, `consolidation/decay.py`, `consolidation/compression.py`, and `consolidation/consolidator.py` (#471, thanks @VibeCodeChef)
- **Refactored `delete_memory()` in HybridMemoryStorage**: Delegates to `delete()` instead of duplicating sync logic, eliminating a potential source of divergence between the two code paths
- **Added missing `datetime` import in `storage/hybrid.py`**: Required for timezone-aware type annotations in `get_access_patterns()` return values
- **`compression.py` isoformat normalization**: Added `.replace('+00:00', 'Z')` for consistent UTC timestamp formatting in compressed memory outputs

### Credits

  - **Impact:** Transforms MCP Memory Service from developer-only to general-purpose semantic memory supporting diverse professional workflows

## [10.11.2] - 2026-02-14

### Fixed
- **Tag Filtering in memory_search (#460):** Fixed critical bugs causing tag filtering to return empty results
  - **JSON Deserialization Bug:** normalize_tags now correctly parses JSON-encoded tag arrays from MCP protocol oneOf schemas (e.g., '["tag1", "tag2"]' → ["tag1", "tag2"])
  - **Post-Limit Filtering Bug:** search_memories now over-fetches all candidates when tags specified (instead of limiting to top N by similarity before tag filtering)
  - **SQL-Level Tag Filtering:** Optimized tag matching with SQL WHERE clauses for better performance
  - **Impact:** Tag-based searches now reliably return all matching memories regardless of semantic similarity ranking

### Security
- **DoS Protection (#460):** Comprehensive hardening against denial-of-service attacks
  - **Vector Search Caps:** Limited k_value to MAX_TAG_SEARCH_CANDIDATES (10,000) to prevent unbounded memory/CPU consumption
  - **JSON Parsing Limits:** Added 4KB size limit (MAX_JSON_LENGTH) before json.loads() to prevent large/nested JSON DoS
  - **Tag Validation:** Sanitized commas in tags (replaced with hyphens) to prevent LIKE-based search breakage
  - **Tag Count Limits:** Capped search tags at 100 to prevent SQLite parameter exhaustion (max 999)
  - **Result:** Balanced recall with resource constraints while maintaining system responsiveness

### Tests
- **Tag Normalization Coverage (#460):** Added 89 new test cases for normalize_tags function
  - JSON-encoded arrays (single, multi-element, whitespace, malformed, empty)
  - DoS protection (large JSON strings, excessive tag counts)
  - Comma sanitization (tag names containing commas)
  - Comprehensive edge cases (None, empty strings, special characters)

## [10.11.1] - 2026-02-12

### Fixed
- **MCP Prompt Handlers (#458, #459):** Fixed AttributeError in all 5 MCP prompt handlers (memory_review, memory_analysis, knowledge_export, memory_cleanup, learning_session)
  - **Root Cause:** Prompt handlers defined as nested functions inside handle_get_prompt() but called as instance methods (self._prompt_*)
  - **Fix:** Changed dispatcher to call nested functions directly by passing self as first argument instead of calling as methods
  - **Impact:** All prompt handlers now work correctly - was causing 100% failure rate
  - **Tests Added:** 5 integration tests in tests/integration/test_prompt_handlers.py to prevent regression

## [10.11.0] - 2026-02-11

### Added
- **SQLite Integrity Monitoring (#456):** Periodic database integrity health checks to prevent data loss from WAL corruption

  - **Impact:** Addresses 15% production data loss from undetected WAL corruption
  - **Technical Implementation:**
    - New module: `src/mcp_memory_service/health/integrity.py` (317 lines)
    - Integration with existing health system and storage backends
    - Graceful error handling with detailed logging and user-facing status messages
  - **Zero-Config Activation:** Works out-of-the-box with sensible defaults for all users

## [10.10.6] - 2026-02-10

### Fixed
- **Test Infrastructure (#317):** Fixed TypedDict import for Python 3.11 compatibility - resolved Pydantic v2.12 error blocking test collection
  - Changed `from typing import TypedDict` to `from typing_extensions import TypedDict` for Python 3.11 support
  - **Result:** All tests now run successfully on Python 3.11+
- **Performance Tests (#318):** Re-enabled pytest-benchmark performance tests with dev dependencies
  - Added pytest-benchmark to dev dependencies in pyproject.toml
  - **Result:** Performance benchmarking now available for development

### Documentation

  - #91: Phase 0 ontology improvements 97% complete (6,542 memories processed)
  - #261: Phase 1 quality system complete, Phase 2 decision needed on Rust vs Python
- **Coverage Baseline (#317):** Established 60.05% coverage baseline with 4-phase improvement plan
  - Phase 1: Core storage/embeddings to 75%+
  - Phase 2: Services to 70%+
  - Phase 3: Server/API to 65%+
  - Phase 4: Utils/edge cases to 60%+

## [10.10.5] - 2026-02-10

### Fixed
- **Embedding Dimension Cache (#412):** Fixed embedding dimension not being restored from model cache, causing dimension mismatches (384 vs 768) across multiple storage instances
  - Added `_DIMENSION_CACHE` dictionary alongside `_MODEL_CACHE` to track embedding dimensions
  - Store dimension when caching models (external API, ONNX, SentenceTransformer)
  - Restore dimension when retrieving cached models
  - **Result:** Consistent embedding dimensions across all storage instances

## [10.10.4] - 2026-02-10

### Fixed
- **CLI Batch Ingestion (#447):** Fixed async bug in `ingest-directory` command causing "NoneType object can't be awaited" errors
  - Made `sqlite_vec.close()` async to match other storage backend interfaces
  - **Result:** CLI batch ingestion now works at 100% success rate (was 9.4% before fix)
- **Test Infrastructure (#451):** Fixed graph visualization validation and test authentication setup
  - **Graph Visualization:** Tightened limit validation from le=1000 to le=500 for consistency with test expectations
  - **Test Authentication:** Fixed module import order causing 15 tests to fail with 401 errors
  - **Result:** All 15 tests now pass (previously 14 failed, 1 xpassed)

## [10.10.3] - 2026-02-10

### Fixed
- **Test Infrastructure (#451):** Fixed test_analytics_graph.py failures causing CI pipeline failures
  - **Graph Visualization Validation:** Tightened limit validation from le=1000 to le=500 for consistency with test expectations and other API limits
  - **Test Authentication:** Fixed module import order issue where config loaded before test environment variables, causing all 15 tests to fail with 401 errors
  - **Result:** All 15 tests now pass (previously 14 failed, 1 xpassed)
- **Memory Scoring (#450):** Fixed score inflation in memory-scorer.js - capped finalScore to 1.0 before applying 0.5x penalty to prevent bonus inflation while preserving cross-project technology sharing

## [10.10.2] - 2026-02-10

### Fixed
- **Memory Injection Filtering (#449):** Fixed two critical bugs preventing proper memory filtering for empty/new projects
  - **minRelevanceScore Enforcement:** Applied configured relevance threshold (default 0.3) in memory scoring filter - was loaded but never enforced, allowing low-relevance cross-project memories (scored ~12% after 85% penalty) to pass through
  - **Project-Affinity Filter:** Added Phase 2 tag-based search filter to prevent cross-project memory pollution - tag searches now require project tag presence or project name mention in content
  - Generic tags (architecture, key-decisions, claude-code-reference) previously returned memories from ALL projects due to OR logic in `/api/search/by-tag` endpoint

### Security
- **Command Injection Prevention (#449):** Replaced `execSync` with `execFileSync` in memory service queries to prevent command injection via project names
- **Log Sanitization (#449):** Added `sanitizeForLog()` function to strip ANSI/control characters from logged project names
- **Null Guards (#449):** Added defensive null/empty checks for `projectTag` in affinity filter

## [10.10.1] - 2026-02-09

### Fixed
- **Search Handler (#444, #446):** Fixed AttributeError in memory_search - handle dict results correctly when storage backend returns dictionaries instead of SearchResult objects
- **Import Error (#443):** Fixed response_limiter import path in server/handlers/memory.py (max_response_chars feature now works)
- **Security (#441):** Added allowlist validation to maintenance scripts (SQL injection prevention in soft_delete_test_memories.py and migration scripts)

### Changed
- **Exact Search Mode (#445):** Changed to case-insensitive substring matching (LIKE) instead of full-content equality for more intuitive search behavior
  - **BREAKING CHANGE:** Users relying on exact full-match behavior may need to adjust queries
  - Previous: `mode=exact` matched only if entire content was identical
  - New: `mode=exact` performs case-insensitive substring search using SQL LIKE operator

### Known Issues
- **CLI Async (#447):** ingest-directory async handling under investigation - deferred to separate PR

## [10.10.0] - 2026-02-08

### Added
- **Environment Configuration Viewer**: New Settings Panel tab for comprehensive environment configuration visibility
  - **New API Endpoint**: `GET /api/config/env` returns 11 categorized parameter groups
  - **11 Configuration Categories**: Storage Backend, Database Settings, HTTP Server, Security, Quality System, Consolidation, OAuth, Embeddings, Logging, Graph Storage, Advanced Settings
  - **Security Features**: Sensitive value masking for API tokens, keys, and credentials
  - **User Experience**: Copy-to-clipboard functionality, dark mode optimization, organized accordion layout
  - **1405+ Lines**: 5 files modified (config_env.py, config.html, config.css, config.js, analytics.py)
  - **Use Cases**: Configuration troubleshooting, team onboarding, environment verification
- **Changelog Archival Agent**: New `changelog-archival` agent automates archival of older CHANGELOG entries when main file exceeds ~1000 lines
  - Automated version boundary detection and safe file splitting
  - Preserves all content in `docs/archive/CHANGELOG-HISTORIC.md`
  - Triggered after major version milestones or on explicit request
  - Maintains lean CHANGELOG focused on recent releases

### Enhanced

  - Parse `metadata` JSON field for enriched node information (quality_score extraction)
  - Include `updated_at` timestamp for tracking node freshness
  - Increased max node limit from 500 to 1000 for larger graph visualization
  - Improved data completeness for analytics and visualization rendering

### Fixed
- **Installation Script Errors** (PR #439): Fixed three critical bugs preventing successful installation
  - Fixed NameError: `install_package` function now properly defined
  - Fixed ModuleNotFoundError: GPU detection uses `importlib.util` for direct file loading to avoid package __init__.py dependency issues during installation
  - Fixed Cloudflare API 401 error: Updated token verification to use account-specific endpoint with proper fallback to user-level endpoint
  - Added safety validations: spec/loader existence checks, account_id validation with `.strip()`
  - **Contributors:** @sykuang

## [10.9.0] - 2026-02-08

### Added
- **Batched Inference for Consolidation Pipeline** (PR #432): 4-16x performance improvement with GPU support
  - **GPU Performance**: 4-16x speedup on RTX 5050 Blackwell (1.4ms/item for batch=16, 0.7ms/item for batch=32 vs 5.2ms/item sequential)
  - **CPU Performance**: 2.3-2.5x speedup with batched ONNX inference
  - **Adaptive GPU Dispatch**: Automatically falls back to sequential processing for small batches (<16 items) to avoid padding overhead
  - **Configuration**:
    - `MCP_QUALITY_BATCH_SIZE` (default: 32) - controls batch size for quality scoring
    - `MCP_QUALITY_MIN_GPU_BATCH` (default: 16) - minimum batch size to use GPU (below threshold uses CPU sequential)
  - **New Methods**:
    - `ONNXRankerModel.score_quality_batch()` - batched DeBERTa classifier and MS-MARCO cross-encoder scoring
    - `QualityEvaluator.evaluate_quality_batch()` - two-pass batch evaluation with fallback strategy
    - `SqliteVecMemoryStorage.store_batch()` - batched embedding generation with atomic transaction handling
    - `SemanticCompressionEngine` - parallel cluster compression via `asyncio.gather`
  - **Backward Compatibility**: 100% backward compatible, set `MCP_QUALITY_BATCH_SIZE=1` for instant rollback
  - **Test Coverage**: 442 lines of new tests (17 tests in `test_batch_inference.py`)
  - **Contributors**: @rodboev

### Fixed
- **Token Truncation**: Fixed character-based [:512] truncation to proper tokenizer truncation (PR #432)
  - **Root Cause**: Classifier scoring truncated at 512 characters before tokenization, discarding ~75% of DeBERTa's 512-token context window (~2000 chars)
  - **Fix**: Enable `truncation(max_length=512)` at tokenizer initialization for all paths (classifier, cross-encoder, sequential, batch)
  - **Impact**: Better quality scores by utilizing full model context window
- **Embedding Orphan Prevention**: Fixed orphaned embeddings in `store()` and `store_batch()` methods (PR #432)
  - **Root Cause**: When embedding INSERT failed, fallback inserted without rowid, breaking `memories.id <-> memory_embeddings.rowid` JOIN
  - **Fix**: Wrap both memory INSERT and embedding INSERT in SAVEPOINT for atomicity - both succeed or both roll back
  - **Impact**: All memories now guaranteed to be searchable via semantic search
- **ONNX Float32 GPU Compatibility**: Cast model to float32 before ONNX export (PR #437)
  - **Root Cause**: DeBERTa v3 stores some weights in float16, producing mixed-precision ONNX graph that ONNX Runtime rejects
  - **Error Message**: "Type parameter (T) of Optype (MatMul) bound to different types (tensor(float16) and tensor(float))"
  - **Fix**: Add `model.float()` after `model.eval()` to cast all parameters to float32 before export
  - **Validation**: Tested on RTX 5050 Blackwell with PyTorch 2.10.0+cu128, ONNX Runtime 1.24.1 (CUDAExecutionProvider)
  - **Contributors**: @rodboev
- **Concurrent Write Stability**: Increased retry budget for WAL mode write contention (PR #435)
  - **Root Cause**: 3 retries with 0.1s initial delay (~0.7s total backoff) insufficient for multiple connections contending for SQLite RESERVED write lock
  - **Fix**: Bumped to 5 retries with 0.2s initial delay (~6.2s total backoff: 0.2+0.4+0.8+1.6+3.2)
  - **Impact**: `test_two_clients_concurrent_write` now passes consistently under WAL mode
  - **Contributors**: @rodboev

## [10.8.0] - 2026-02-08

### Added
- **Hybrid BM25 + Vector Search** (Issue #175, PR #436): Combines keyword matching with semantic search for improved exact match scoring
  - FTS5-based BM25 keyword search with trigram tokenizer for multilingual support
  - Parallel execution of BM25 and vector searches (<15ms typical latency)
  - Configurable score fusion weights (default: 30% keyword, 70% semantic)
  - Automatic FTS5 index synchronization via database triggers
  - Backward compatible: existing `mode="semantic"` searches unchanged
  - Available via unified search interface: `mode="hybrid"`
  - Configuration options:
    - `MCP_HYBRID_SEARCH_ENABLED`: Enable hybrid search (default: true)
    - `MCP_HYBRID_KEYWORD_WEIGHT`: BM25 weight (default: 0.3)
    - `MCP_HYBRID_SEMANTIC_WEIGHT`: Vector weight (default: 0.7)
  - Comprehensive test suite: 12 tests covering unit, integration, performance
  - Performance: <50ms average latency for 100 memories
  - Reference implementation: AgentKits Memory (sub-10ms latency, 70% token efficiency gains)

### Fixed
- **search_memories() Response Format** (PR #436): Corrected pre-existing bug where `search_memories()` returned Memory objects instead of dictionaries with `similarity_score`
  - Now returns flat dictionaries with all memory fields plus `similarity_score`
  - Updated affected tests (test_issue_396, hybrid search tests) to use dictionary access
  - Maintains API specification compliance
- **Test Safety: Prevent accidental Cloudflare data deletion** (Commit d3d8425): Tests now force `sqlite_vec` backend to prevent soft-deleting production memories in Cloudflare D1
  - Automatically overrides `MCP_MEMORY_STORAGE_BACKEND` to `sqlite_vec` for all test runs
  - Prints warning when overriding a cloud backend setting
  - Allows explicit cloud testing via `MCP_TEST_ALLOW_CLOUD_BACKEND=true`
- **Test Safety: Comprehensive safeguards to prevent production database deletion** (PR #438): Implemented triple safety system after incident on 2026-02-08 where test cleanup deleted 8,663 production memories
  - **Forced Test Database Path**: Creates isolated temp directory with `mcp-test-` prefix at module import time, forces `MCP_MEMORY_SQLITE_PATH` to test database
  - **Pre-Test Verification**: `pytest_sessionstart` hook verifies database is in temp directory, **aborts test run** if production path detected
  - **Triple-Check Cleanup**: `pytest_sessionfinish` validates (1) temp directory location, (2) no production indicators, (3) test markers present
  - **Critical Change**: Removed `allow_production=True` bypass flag - now relies on `delete_by_tag`'s own safety checks
  - **Additional Safeguards**: Backend forced to `sqlite_vec` unless explicitly allowed, verbose logging, explicit error handling
  - **Impact**: Defense in depth with 4 layers - environment override, pre-test abort, triple-check cleanup, backend-level safety
  - **Files Modified**: `tests/conftest.py` (+130 lines of safety code)
- **Dashboard Version Display**: Updated `src/mcp_memory_service/_version.py` to v10.8.0 (was showing v10.7.2 in dashboard)

## [10.7.2] - 2026-02-07

### Fixed
- **Server Management buttons cause page reload** (PR #429): Added `type="button"` to Check for Updates, Update & Restart, and Restart Server buttons in Settings modal. Without explicit type, buttons inside `<form>` default to `type="submit"`, causing unintended form submission and page reload.

## [10.7.1] - 2026-02-07

### Fixed
- **Test Script Security Hardening** (Issue #419, PR #427): Hardened test backup scripts with several security and robustness fixes:
  - **Command Injection (HIGH)**: Replaced unquoted heredoc with quoted `<< 'EOF'` + `printf '%q'` for safe path escaping
  - **Argument Injection**: Added `--` separators to `sqlite3` and `rm` commands
  - **Database Corruption Risk**: Replaced `cp` with `sqlite3 .backup` for atomic, WAL-safe backups
  - **Overly Broad pkill**: Narrowed pattern from `"memory server"` to `"mcp_memory_service"`
  - **Cross-Platform Documentation**: Added platform-specific path table (macOS/Linux/Windows) to README
  - **Test Fix**: Added auth dependency overrides to quality HTTP endpoint tests
- **Dashboard Authentication for API Calls** (Commit 5bf4834): Added authentication headers to all Dashboard API endpoints
  - **Frontend Fixes**: Replaced 19 direct `fetch()` calls with `this.apiCall()` for proper auth header handling
  - **Affected Tabs**: Manage, Analytics, Quality tabs now properly authenticate
  - **FormData Uploads**: Added auth headers to 2 document upload fetch calls
  - **API Middleware**: Added auth middleware to consolidation API (3 endpoints: trigger, status, recommendations)
  - **API Middleware**: Added auth middleware to quality API (5 endpoints: rate, evaluate, get, distribution, trends)
  - **API Overview Page**: Fixed `/api-overview` page to pass auth headers to `/api/health/detailed` fetch calls
  - **Root Cause**: Direct fetch() calls bypassed the apiCall() auth layer, causing 401 errors when API key authentication was enabled
  - **Files Changed**: 5 files modified (app.js, index.html, consolidation.py, quality.py, app.py)
  - **Impact**: All Dashboard features now work correctly with API key authentication enabled

## [10.7.0] - 2026-02-07

## [10.6.1] - 2026-02-07

### Fixed
- **Dashboard SSE Authentication** (Issue #420, PR #423): Fixed EventSource API authentication for Server-Sent Events
  - **Root Cause**: Browser `EventSource` API does not support custom headers, causing 401 errors on `/api/events` endpoint
  - **Solution**: Pass authentication credentials as URL query parameters (`api_key=` and `token=` for OAuth)
  - **Implementation**: Used `URL` and `URLSearchParams` APIs for clean query parameter handling
  - **OAuth Support**: Added `token` query parameter support in auth middleware for SSE connections
  - **Security**: Added `<meta name="referrer" content="no-referrer">` to prevent API key leakage via HTTP Referer headers
  - **Impact**: Dashboard now maintains real-time SSE connection when authentication is enabled

  - Simplifies user workflow with unified command interface
  - Removes confusion about separate MCP vs HTTP server commands

## [10.4.4] - 2026-02-05

### Security
- **CRITICAL: Timing Attack Vulnerability** (PR #411): Fixed CWE-208 timing attack in API key comparison
  - Replaced direct string comparison with `secrets.compare_digest()` for constant-time comparison
  - Prevents attackers from determining correct API key character-by-character via timing analysis
  - All API key authentication methods now use secure comparison (X-API-Key header, query parameter, Bearer token)
  - Severity: CRITICAL - Recommend immediate upgrade for all deployments using API key authentication

### Fixed
- **API Key Authentication without OAuth** (Issue #407, PR #411): API key auth now works independently of OAuth configuration
  - Root cause: API routes had conditional OAuth dependencies that prevented API key authentication when `MCP_OAUTH_ENABLED=false`
  - Solution: Removed OAuth conditionals from ALL 44 API route endpoints
  - Authentication middleware now handles all auth methods unconditionally: OAuth, API key, or anonymous
  - Enables simple single-user deployments without OAuth overhead

### Added
- **X-API-Key Header Authentication** (PR #411): Recommended method for API key authentication
  - Usage: `curl -H "X-API-Key: your-secret-key" http://localhost:8000/api/memories`
  - More secure than query parameters (not logged in server logs)
  - Works with all API endpoints
- **Query Parameter Authentication** (PR #411): Convenient fallback for scripts/browsers
  - Usage: `curl "http://localhost:8000/api/memories?api_key=your-secret-key"`
  - Warning: Logs API keys in server logs - use X-API-Key header in production
- **Bearer Token Compatibility** (PR #411): Backward compatible with existing Bearer token auth
  - Usage: `curl -H "Authorization: Bearer your-secret-key" http://localhost:8000/api/memories`

### Changed
- **OAuth Import Behavior** (PR #411): OAuth authentication modules now always imported regardless of configuration
  - Previous behavior caused FastAPI AssertionError when `OAUTH_ENABLED=false`
  - Middleware decides auth method at runtime based on configuration
  - Allows server startup with OAuth disabled while maintaining proper authentication

## [10.4.3] - 2026-02-04

### Fixed
- **Consolidation Logger** (PR #404): Fixed NameError in consolidator.py where logger.warning() was called but no module-level logger existed
  - Added module-level logger import to prevent crashes in `_handle_compression_results` and `_apply_forgetting_results` methods
  - Ensures proper error logging during memory consolidation operations

  - Added executable path logging for easier Task Scheduler debugging
  - Improved Python version discovery with py.exe launcher and descending version sort (prefers latest)

## [10.4.2] - 2026-02-01

### Fixed
- **Docker Container Startup** (Issue #400): Fixed ModuleNotFoundError for aiosqlite and core dependencies
  - Docker container failed to start with "ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'aiosqlite'"
  - Root cause: `uv pip install -e .${INSTALL_EXTRA}` was not properly installing core dependencies
  - Solution: Split Docker package installation into three clear steps:
    1. Install CPU-only PyTorch if needed (conditional)
    2. Always install core dependencies with `python -m uv pip install -e .`
    3. Install optional dependencies with `python -m uv pip install -e ".${INSTALL_EXTRA}"`
  - This ensures all core dependencies (aiosqlite, fastapi, sqlite-vec, etc.) are always installed
  - Preserved backward compatibility with all build argument combinations
  - Verified with testing: core dependencies properly installed in all configurations

## [10.4.1] - 2026-01-29

### Fixed
- **Time Expression Parsing** (Issue #396): Fixed `time_expr` parameter to correctly parse natural language time expressions
  - Changed from `extract_time_expression()` to `parse_time_expression()` in `search_memories()`
  - Now correctly handles: "last week", "3 days ago", "last 5 days", "1 week ago"
  - `extract_time_expression()` was designed for extracting time expressions from larger text queries
  - `parse_time_expression()` is the correct function for isolated time expressions
  - Added comprehensive regression tests covering reported failures and edge cases
  - ISO date workaround (`after`/`before` parameters) continues to work as before

    - `MCP_SEMANTIC_DEDUP_THRESHOLD` (default: 0.85) - Similarity threshold (0.0-1.0)
  - Catches cross-hook duplicates (e.g., PostToolUse + SessionEnd reformulations)
  - Returns descriptive error messages: "Duplicate content detected (semantically similar to {hash}...)"
  - Efficient KNN search using sqlite-vec's `vec_distance_cosine()` function
  - Comprehensive test suite with 6 new tests covering time windows, configuration, and edge cases

- **Memory Budget Optimization** (Issue #390): Increased memory retrieval capacity and reserved slots for curated memories
  - Increased `maxMemoriesPerSession` from 8 to 14 slots (75% increase)
  - New `reservedTagSlots` configuration (default: 3) - Guarantees minimum slots for tag-based retrieval
  - Smart slot allocation across retrieval phases:
    - Phase 0 (Git): Up to 3 slots (adaptive)
    - Phase 1 (Recent): ~60% of remaining slots
    - Phase 2 (Tags): At least `reservedTagSlots`, more if available
  - Prevents semantic search from crowding out curated memories
  - Configuration documentation added to session-start.js

  - Applied across all tag sources: parameter tags, metadata tags, hook-generated tags
  - JavaScript hooks updated for consistent case-normalization:
    - auto-capture-patterns.js: generateTags() normalizes all tags
    - session-end.js: Project name, language, topics, frameworks all lowercase
  - Comprehensive test suite with 11 new tests for unit and integration scenarios
  - Backward compatible: Existing mixed-case tags remain unchanged, searches already case-insensitive

- **Hook Deduplication Threshold** (Issue #391): Improved Jaccard similarity detection
  - Lowered threshold from 80% to 65% in context-formatter.js
  - Catches more cross-hook reformulations (55-70% similarity range)
  - Maintains balance between duplicate detection and legitimate variations

### Fixed
- **Test Environment Isolation**: Disabled semantic deduplication during tests
  - Prevents interference with existing test expectations
  - Tests can now create similar content without triggering dedup
  - Added clear documentation in conftest.py

### Documentation

### Major Changes

**MCP Tool Consolidation: 34 → 12 Tools (64% API Simplification)**

The most significant API redesign in MCP Memory Service history - consolidating 34 tools into 12 unified tools for better usability, maintainability, and MCP best practices compliance. While technically maintaining 100% backwards compatibility, this represents a new generation of the API architecture warranting a major version bump.

**Key Achievements:**
- **64% Tool Reduction**: 34 tools → 12 tools with enhanced capabilities
- **100% Backwards Compatibility**: All 33 deprecated tools continue working with deprecation warnings
- **Zero Breaking Changes**: Existing integrations work unchanged until v11.0.0
- **Enhanced Capabilities**: New unified tools offer combined functionality (e.g., filter by tags + time range)
- **Comprehensive Testing**: 62 new tests added (100% pass rate, 968 total tests)
- **Migration Guide**: Complete documentation in `docs/MIGRATION.md`

```python
# Old (v9.x) - Required multiple tool calls
delete_by_tags(tags=["temp"])  # First call
delete_by_timeframe(start="2024-01-01")  # Second call

# New (v10.0+) - Single unified call
memory_delete(tags=["temp"], after="2024-01-01", tag_match="any")
```

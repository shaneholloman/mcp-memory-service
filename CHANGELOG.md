- **Installation Scripts**: One-command installation and configuration
- **Management Scripts**: Easy service lifecycle management
- **Archive Organization**: Clean separation of development and production files

### Configuration
#### üîß **New Environment Variables**
- `MCP_CONSOLIDATION_ENABLED`: Enable/disable autonomous consolidation (default: true)
- `MCP_MDNS_ENABLED`: Enable/disable mDNS service discovery (default: true)
- `MCP_MDNS_SERVICE_NAME`: Customizable service name for discovery (default: "MCP Memory")
- `MCP_HTTPS_ENABLED`: Enable HTTPS with auto-generated certificates (default: true)
- `MCP_HTTP_HOST`: Server bind address (default: 0.0.0.0 for multi-client)
- `MCP_HTTP_PORT`: Server port (default: 8000)
- Consolidation timing controls: `MCP_SCHEDULE_DAILY`, `MCP_SCHEDULE_WEEKLY`, `MCP_SCHEDULE_MONTHLY`

### Breaking Changes
- **Architecture Change**: Single-client MCP protocol ‚Üí Multi-client HTTPS server architecture
- **Service Discovery**: Manual configuration ‚Üí Automatic mDNS discovery
- **Deployment Model**: Development script ‚Üí Production systemd service
- **Access Method**: Direct library import ‚Üí HTTP API with authentication

### Migration
- **Client Configuration**: Update to use HTTP-MCP bridge with auto-discovery
- **Service Deployment**: Install systemd service for production use
- **Network Setup**: Configure firewall for ports 8000/tcp (HTTPS) and 5353/udp (mDNS)
- **API Access**: Use generated API key for authentication

### Technical Details

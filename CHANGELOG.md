## [Unreleased]

## [9.2.1] - 2026-01-19

### Fixed
- **CRITICAL: Knowledge Graph table initialization bug** (#362)
  - **Root Cause**: Migration files existed but were never executed during storage initialization
  - **Impact**: All Knowledge Graph operations failed with "no such table: memory_graph" errors
  - **Solution**: Created MigrationRunner utility to execute SQL migrations during SqliteVecMemoryStorage.initialize()
  - **Migrations Applied**: Graph table migrations (008, 009, 010) now run automatically
  - **Test Results**: Knowledge Graph tests improved from 14/51 to 44/51 passing (37 fixes)
  - **Full Test Suite**: 910 tests passing, 0 regressions introduced
  - **Idempotency**: Migration runner handles duplicate column errors gracefully (non-fatal warnings)
  - **Technical Details**:
    - New `MigrationRunner` class in `storage/migration_runner.py` (190 lines)
    - Integrated into `SqliteVecMemoryStorage.initialize()` with 48 new lines
    - 340 lines of comprehensive unit tests (10 test cases)
    - Supports both sync and async migration execution
    - Non-fatal error handling (logs warnings, doesn't crash)
  - **Remaining Issues**: 7 Knowledge Graph test failures are pre-existing bugs (deprecated API usage, not related to this fix)

### Technical Details
- Migration runner executes migrations in both new database and existing database initialization paths
- Skips already-applied migrations automatically (e.g., duplicate columns)
- Ensures memory_graph table is always available for graph operations
- No user action required - migrations run automatically on next storage initialization

## [9.2.0] - 2026-01-18

### Added
- **Knowledge Graph Dashboard with D3.js v7.9.0** - Interactive force-directed graph visualization
  - **Interactive Force-Directed Graph**: Zoom, pan, drag nodes to explore memory relationships

- All backends tested with identical test suite (parametrized fixtures)

## [9.0.5] - 2026-01-18

🚨 **CRITICAL HOTFIX** - Fixes OAuth 2.1 token endpoint routing bug

### Fixed
- **CRITICAL: OAuth 2.1 token endpoint routing fixed** (Issue #358)
  - **Root Cause**: `@router.post("/token")` decorator was on wrong function (`_handle_authorization_code_grant` instead of `token`)
  - **Impact**: Token endpoint completely non-functional for all standard OAuth clients (Claude Desktop, MCPJam, etc.)
  - **Symptoms**: HTTP 422 Unprocessable Entity errors when attempting to exchange authorization codes for access tokens
  - **Incident**: OAuth clients could not complete authorization code flow - authorization succeeded but token exchange failed
  - **Fix**: Moved `@router.post("/token")` decorator from internal helper function to correct public endpoint handler
  - **Files Changed**:
    - `src/mcp_memory_service/web/oauth/authorization.py:220` - Removed decorator from `_handle_authorization_code_grant`
    - `src/mcp_memory_service/web/oauth/authorization.py:348` - Added decorator to `token` function
  - **OAuth 2.1 Compliance**: Token endpoint now correctly implements RFC 6749 token exchange flow
  - **Backward Compatibility**: Fixes broken functionality introduced in recent OAuth refactoring
  - **Recommendation**: All users attempting to use OAuth authentication should upgrade to v9.0.5 immediately
- **Script reliability improvements for update and server management**
  - **Network error handling**: Added retry logic (up to 3 attempts) to `update_and_restart.sh` for transient DNS/network failures
    - Network connectivity check before pip install (ping 8.8.8.8, 1.1.1.1)
    - 2-second delay between retries, 5-second wait when network check fails
    - Clear error messages with helpful suggestions on failure
    - Fixes DNS errors: "nodename nor servname provided, or not known" (Errno 8)
  - **Server startup timeout**: Increased HTTP server initialization timeout from 10s to 20s
    - Hybrid storage + embedding model loading takes 12-15 seconds
    - Previous 10s timeout caused false "failed to start" errors
    - Updated `http_server_manager.sh` to allow adequate initialization time
  - **User Impact**: More reliable updates on unstable networks, no more premature timeout failures
  - **Files Changed**:
    - `scripts/update_and_restart.sh:349-398` - Network retry logic
    - `scripts/service/http_server_manager.sh:182-185` - Timeout increase
  - **Testing**: Server restart verified successful (6-13s startup, well within 20s limit)

## [9.0.4] - 2026-01-17

🚨 **CRITICAL HOTFIX** - Fixes OAuth validation blocking server startup

### Fixed
- **CRITICAL: OAuth validation preventing server startup** (discovered in v9.0.3)
  - **Root Cause**: `OAUTH_ENABLED` defaulted to `True`, causing OAuth validation to run on every import
  - **Impact**: Server startup failed with `ValueError: Invalid OAuth configuration: JWT configuration error: No JWT signing key available`
  - **Symptoms**: `update_and_restart.sh` fails during dependency installation, config.py import fails
  - **Fix**: Changed `OAUTH_ENABLED` default from `True` to `False` (opt-in, not opt-out)
  - **Fix**: Made OAuth validation non-fatal (logs errors but doesn't raise exception)
  - **Files Changed**:
    - `src/mcp_memory_service/config.py:690` - Changed default to `False`
    - `src/mcp_memory_service/config.py:890-895` - Made validation non-fatal
  - **Backward Compatibility**: No impact (OAuth was broken by default, now works correctly)
  - **Recommendation**: All users on v9.0.3 should upgrade to v9.0.4 immediately

## [9.0.3] - 2026-01-17

🚨 **CRITICAL HOTFIX** - Fixes Cloudflare D1 schema migration bug causing container reboot loop

### Fixed
- **CRITICAL: Add automatic schema migration for Cloudflare D1 backend** (Issue #354)
  - **Root Cause**: v8.72.0 added `tags` and `deleted_at` columns but Cloudflare backend had no migration logic
  - **Impact**: Users upgrading from v8.69.0 → v8.72.0+ experienced container reboot loop due to missing columns
  - **Symptoms**: `400 Bad Request` errors from D1 when trying to use missing columns
  - **Fix**: Added `_migrate_d1_schema()` method with automatic column detection and migration
  - **Fix**: Added retry logic with exponential backoff to handle D1 metadata sync issues
  - **Fix**: Added clear error messages with manual SQL workaround if automated migration fails
  - **Files Changed**:
    - `src/mcp_memory_service/storage/cloudflare.py:290-495` - Added migration methods
  - **Migration Process**:
    1. Check existing schema using `PRAGMA table_info(memories)`
    2. Add missing columns: `tags TEXT`, `deleted_at REAL DEFAULT NULL`
    3. Create index: `idx_memories_deleted_at`
    4. Verify columns are usable (handles D1 metadata sync issues)
  - **Backward Compatibility**: Safe for all versions (idempotent, no data loss)
  - **Manual Workaround** (if automated migration fails):
    ```sql
    ALTER TABLE memories ADD COLUMN tags TEXT;
    ALTER TABLE memories ADD COLUMN deleted_at REAL DEFAULT NULL;
    CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_memories_deleted_at ON memories(deleted_at);
    ```
  - **Recommendation**: All Cloudflare users on v8.72.0+ should upgrade to v9.0.3 immediately

## [9.0.2] - 2026-01-17

🚨 **CRITICAL HOTFIX** - Actually includes the code fix from v9.0.1

### Fixed
- **CRITICAL: Include actual code changes for mass deletion bug fix**
  - **Issue**: v9.0.1 was tagged and released WITHOUT the actual code changes to `manage.py`
  - **Root Cause**: Code changes were committed AFTER the v9.0.1 tag was created
  - **Impact**: PyPI and Docker images for v9.0.1 do NOT contain the fix
  - **This Release**: v9.0.2 includes the actual code changes from commit 9c5ed87
  - **Files Fixed**:
    - `src/mcp_memory_service/web/api/manage.py:254` - `confirm_count` now REQUIRED
    - Added comprehensive security documentation and error messages
  - **Recommendation**: All users should upgrade to v9.0.2 (not v9.0.1)

## [9.0.1] - 2026-01-17

⚠️ **WARNING**: This release was tagged incorrectly and does NOT include the actual code fix. Please upgrade to v9.0.2 instead.

🚨 **CRITICAL HOTFIX** - Fixes accidental mass deletion bug in v9.0.0

### Fixed
- **CRITICAL: Fix accidental mass deletion via /delete-untagged endpoint** (Hotfix)
  - **Root Cause**: `confirm_count` parameter was optional in `/api/manage/delete-untagged` endpoint
  - **Impact**: If endpoint called without `confirm_count`, ALL untagged memories were deleted without confirmation
  - **Incident**: On 2026-01-17 at 10:59:20, 6733 memories (87% of database) were accidentally soft-deleted
  - **Fix**: Made `confirm_count` parameter REQUIRED (not optional)
  - **Fix**: Enhanced safety check to always validate confirm_count matches actual count
  - **Fix**: Improved error message to guide users to use GET /api/manage/count-untagged first
  - **Security**: Added comprehensive documentation about the security implications
  - **Recovery**: All affected memories can be restored by setting `deleted_at = NULL`
  - **File**: `src/mcp_memory_service/web/api/manage.py:254`
  - **Breaking Change**: API now requires `confirm_count` parameter (previously optional)
  - **Recommendation**: All v9.0.0 users should upgrade immediately to v9.0.1

## [9.0.0] - 2026-01-17

⚠️ **MAJOR RELEASE** - Contains breaking changes. See Migration Guide in README.md.

### Fixed
- **Fix 33 API/HTTP test failures with package import error** (Issue #351, PR #352)
  - Changed relative imports to absolute imports in `web/api/backup.py` for pytest compatibility
  - Fixed `ModuleNotFoundError: 'mcp_memory_service' is not a package` during test collection
  - Resolved pytest `--import-mode=prepend` confusion with triple-dot relative imports
  - **Test Results**: 829/914 tests passing (up from 818), all API/HTTP integration tests pass
  - **Impact**: Single-line fix, no API changes, no breaking changes

- **Fix validation tests and legacy type migration** (PR #350)
  - Fixed all 5 validation tests (editable install detection, version matching, runtime warnings)
  - Fixed `check_dev_setup.py` to import `_version.py` directly instead of text parsing
  - Fixed timestamp test import error (namespace collision in `models` import)
  - Migrated 38 legacy memory types to new ontology (task→observation, note→observation, standard→observation)
  - Pinned `numpy<2` for pandas compatibility (prevents binary incompatibility errors)
  - Extracted offline mode setup to standalone `offline_mode.py` module (cleaner package structure)
  - Restored core imports in `__init__.py` for pytest package recognition
  - Updated consolidation retention periods for new ontology types
  - **Test Results**: 818/851 tests passing (96%), all validation tests pass

- **Fix bidirectional storage for asymmetric relationships** ⚠️ **BREAKING CHANGE** (Issue #348, PR #349)
  - Asymmetric relationships (causes, fixes, supports, follows) now store only directed edges
  - Symmetric relationships (related, contradicts) continue storing bidirectional edges
  - Database migration (010) removes incorrect reverse edges from existing data
  - Query infrastructure with `direction` parameter now works correctly with asymmetric storage
  - SemanticReasoner methods (find_causes, find_fixes) validated with new storage model
  - New `is_symmetric_relationship()` function in ontology.py for relationship classification
  - Updated `store_association()` to conditionally store edges based on relationship symmetry
  - Updated `find_connected()` direction="both" to use CASE expression for asymmetric edges
  - **Breaking Change**: Code expecting bidirectional asymmetric edges needs `direction="both"` parameter

### Added
- **Phase 0 Ontology Foundation - Core Implementation** ⚠️ **BREAKING CHANGE** (PR #347)
  - **Memory Type Ontology**: Formal classification system with 5 base types and 21 subtypes
    - Base types: observation, decision, learning, error, pattern
    - Hierarchical taxonomy with parent-child relationships
    - Soft validation: defaults to 'observation' for invalid types (backward compatible)
  - **Tag Taxonomy**: Structured namespace system with 6 predefined namespaces
    - Namespaces: `sys:`, `q:`, `proj:`, `topic:`, `t:`, `user:`
    - Backward compatible with legacy tags (no namespace)
    - O(1) namespace validation via exposed `VALID_NAMESPACES` class attribute
  - **Typed Relationships**: Semantic relationship system for knowledge graph
    - 6 relationship types: causes, fixes, contradicts, supports, follows, related
    - Database migration adds `relationship_type` column to memory_graph table
    - `TypedAssociation` dataclass for explicit relationship semantics
    - GraphStorage extended with relationship type filtering in queries
  - **Lightweight Reasoning Engine**: Foundation for causal inference
    - `SemanticReasoner` class with contradiction detection
    - Causal chain analysis: `find_fixes()`, `find_causes()`
    - Placeholder methods for future reasoning capabilities
  - **Performance Optimizations**: Caching and validation improvements
    - `get_all_types()`: 97.5x speedup via module-level caching
    - `get_parent_type()`: 35.9x speedup via cached reverse lookup map
    - Tag validation: 47.3% speedup (eliminated double parsing)
  - **Security Improvements**: Template-based SQL query building
  - **Testing**: 80 comprehensive tests with 100% backward compatibility
  - **Breaking Change**: Legacy types (task, note, standard) deprecated, automatically migrated via soft-validation (defaults to 'observation')

- **Response Size Limiter** (PR #344)
  - Added `max_response_chars` parameter to 5 memory retrieval tools to prevent context window overflow
  - Tools updated: `retrieve_memory`, `recall_memory`, `retrieve_with_quality_boost`, `search_by_tag`, `recall_by_timeframe`
  - Environment variable: `MCP_MAX_RESPONSE_CHARS` (default: 0 = unlimited)
  - Truncates at memory boundaries (never mid-content) to preserve data integrity
  - Always returns at least one memory even if it exceeds the character limit
  - Displays truncation warning with shown/total counts when limit is applied
  - New utility module: `src/mcp_memory_service/server/utils/response_limiter.py` (260 lines)
  - Comprehensive test coverage: 29 tests (415 lines) covering edge cases
  - Recommended values: 30000-50000 characters for typical LLM context windows
  - Backward compatible: existing code continues to work with unlimited responses

## [8.76.0] - 2026-01-12

### Added
- **Official Lite Distribution Support** (PR #341)
  - **New Package**: `mcp-memory-service-lite` - Official lightweight distribution for ONNX-only installations
    - 90% installation size reduction: 7.7GB → 805MB
    - Same nvidia-quality-classifier-deberta ONNX model, just lighter dependency chain
    - Faster installation time: <2 minutes vs 10-15 minutes
  - **Dual Package Publishing**: Automated CI/CD workflow (`publish-dual.yml`) publishes both packages to PyPI
    - Full package: `mcp-memory-service` (includes transformers, torch, sentence-transformers)
    - Lite package: `mcp-memory-service-lite` (ONNX-only, tokenizers-based embeddings)
    - Both packages share the same codebase via pyproject-lite.toml
  - **Conditional Dependency Loading**: Transformers becomes truly optional
    - Quality scoring works with tokenizers-only (lite) or full transformers (full package)
    - Graceful fallback: embedding service detects available packages and loads accordingly
    - No runtime performance impact - same quality scoring performance
  - **Implementation Details**:
    - Created `pyproject-lite.toml` with minimal dependencies (no transformers/torch)
    - Updated `onnx_ranker.py` to use tokenizers directly instead of transformers
    - Fixed quality_provider metadata access bug in async_scorer.py
    - 15 comprehensive integration tests (`tests/test_lightweight_onnx.py`, 487 lines)
  - **Documentation**:
    - Complete setup guide: `docs/LIGHTWEIGHT_ONNX_SETUP.md`
    - Setup script: `scripts/setup-lightweight.sh`
  - **Use Cases**:
    - CI/CD pipelines (faster builds, lower disk usage)
    - Resource-constrained environments (VPS, containers)
    - Quick local development setup
    - Users who only need quality scoring (not full ML features)
- **Production Refactor Command**: Added `/refactor-function-prod` command for production-ready code refactoring
  - Enhanced version of the refactor-function PoC with production features
- **Refactoring Metrics Documentation**: Comprehensive Issue #340 refactoring documentation in `.metrics/`
  - Baseline complexity measurements
  - Complexity comparison showing 75.2% average reduction
  - Tracking tables and completion reports

### Fixed
- **Multi-Protocol Port Detection and Cross-Platform Fallback** (`scripts/service/http_server_manager.sh`)
  - **Problem**: Update script failed with port conflict on Linux systems without lsof installed
  - **Root Causes**:
    - Script used lsof exclusively for port detection, silently failed on systems without it (common on Arch/Manjaro)
    - Health checks only tried HTTP protocol, failed when server used HTTPS
    - Led to "server not running" false positive → attempted restart → port conflict error
  - **Solution**:
    - Implemented 4-level port detection fallback chain: lsof → ss → netstat → ps
    - Health check now tries both HTTP and HTTPS protocols with automatic fallback
    - Explicit error messages when all detection methods fail
    - Cross-platform compatibility validated on Arch Linux with ss-only environment
  - **Testing**: Manual testing on Arch Linux without lsof, confirmed fallback to ss works correctly
  - **Impact**: Resolves installation failures on minimal Linux distributions, improves HTTPS deployment reliability
- **MCP HTTP Transport**: Fix KeyError 'backend_info' in get_cache_stats tool (Issue #342, PR #343)
  - **Problem**: `get_cache_stats` tool crashed with `KeyError: 'backend_info'` when called via HTTP transport
  - **Root Cause**: Code tried to set `result["backend_info"]["embedding_model"]` without creating the dict first
  - **Solution**: Create complete `backend_info` dict with all required fields (storage_backend, sqlite_path, embedding_model)
  - **Impact**: HIGH severity (tool completely broken in HTTP transport), LOW risk fix
  - **Testing**: Added regression test validating backend_info structure
  - Thanks to @Sundeepg98 for reporting with clear reproduction steps!
- **Hook Installer**: Auto-register PreToolUse hook in settings.json (Issue #335)
  - **Problem**: `permission-request.js` was copied but never registered in `settings.json`, so the hook never executed
  - **Solution**: Installer now auto-adds PreToolUse hook configuration for MCP permission management
  - Added 7 new safe patterns: `store`, `remember`, `ingest`, `rate`, `proactive`, `context`, `summary`, `recommendations`
  - Hook now correctly auto-approves additive operations (e.g., `store_memory`)
- **Memory Hooks**: Fix cluster memory categorization showing incorrect dates
  - **Problem**: Consolidated cluster memories (from consolidation system) showed "🕒 today" in "Recent Work" section because hook used `created_at` (when cluster was created) instead of `temporal_span` (time period the cluster represents)
  - **Solution**: Added new "📦 Consolidated Memories" section with proper temporal span display (e.g., "📅 180d span")
  - **Changes**: Updated `claude-hooks/utilities/context-formatter.js` to detect `compressed_cluster` memory type and display `metadata.temporal_span.span_days`
  - **Impact**: Prevents confusion between recent development and historical memory summaries

### Changed
- **Hook Installer**: Refactored MCP configuration detection functions for improved maintainability (Issue #340)
  - Reduced complexity by 45.5% across 3 core functions
  - Extracted 6 well-structured helper functions (avg complexity 3.83)
  - Fixed validation bug: Added 'detected' server type support (PR #339 follow-up)
  - Improved code grade distribution: 58% A-grade functions (up from 53%)
- **Memory Consolidation**: Improved cluster concept quality with intelligent deduplication
  - **Problem**: Cluster summaries showed redundant concepts (e.g., "memories, Memories, MEMORY, memory") and noise (SQL keywords like "BETWEEN")
  - **Solution**: Added case-insensitive deduplication and filtering of SQL keywords/meta-concepts
  - **Changes**: Enhanced `_extract_key_concepts()` in `consolidation/compression.py` to deduplicate case variants and filter 10 SQL keywords + 6 meta-concepts
  - **Impact**: Cluster summaries now show meaningful thematic concepts instead of technical noise

## [8.75.1] - 2026-01-10

### Fixed
- **Hook Installer**: Support flexible MCP server naming conventions (PR #339)
  - **Problem**: Installer required exact server name `memory`, causing installation failures for users with custom MCP configurations (e.g., `mcp-memory-service`, `memory-service`)
  - **Solution**:
    - Installer now detects servers matching patterns: `memory`, `mcp-memory`, `*memory*service*`, `*memory*server*`
    - Backward compatible with existing `memory` server name
    - Provides clear error messages when no matching server found
    - Improved user experience for custom MCP configurations
  - **Testing**: Manual testing with various server name configurations
  - **Contributors**: Thanks to @timkjr for reporting and testing the fix!

## [8.75.0] - 2026-01-09

### Added
- **Lightweight ONNX Quality Scoring without Transformers Dependency** (PR #337)
  - **Problem**: transformers package adds 6.9GB of dependencies (torch, tensorflow, etc.), making installation bloated for users who only need quality scoring
  - **Solution**: Use tokenizers package directly instead of transformers
    - 90% disk space reduction: 7.7GB → 805MB total installation
    - Same ONNX model (nvidia-quality-classifier-deberta), just lighter dependency chain
    - Conditional dependency loading - only install what you use
  - **Implementation**:
    - Modified `src/mcp_memory_service/quality/onnx_ranker.py` to use tokenizers directly
    - Added tokenizers as optional dependency in pyproject.toml
    - Updated embedding service to handle both tokenizers and transformers (graceful fallback)
    - Fixed quality_provider metadata access bug in async_scorer.py
  - **Testing**: 15 comprehensive integration tests (`tests/test_lightweight_onnx.py`, 487 lines)
  - **Documentation**:
    - Complete setup guide: `docs/LIGHTWEIGHT_ONNX_SETUP.md`
    - Setup script: `scripts/setup-lightweight.sh`
  - **Benefits**:
    - Faster installation (<2 min vs 10-15 min)
    - Lower disk usage (805MB vs 7.7GB)
    - Same quality scoring performance
    - No runtime performance impact

### Fixed
- **Multi-Protocol and Cross-Platform Port Detection** (`scripts/service/http_server_manager.sh`)
  - **Problem**: Update script failed with port conflict on Linux systems without lsof installed
  - **Root Cause**:
    - Script used lsof exclusively, silently failed on systems without it (common on Arch/Manjaro)
    - Health checks only tried HTTP, failed when server used HTTPS
    - Led to "server not running" false positive → port conflict
  - **Solution**:
    - Port detection fallback chain: lsof → ss → netstat → ps
    - Health check supports both HTTP and HTTPS protocols with automatic fallback
    - Tested on Arch Linux with ss-only environment
  - **Fixes**: Issue #341

## [8.74.0] - 2026-01-09

### Added
- **Cross-Platform Wrapper Scripts for Orphan Process Cleanup** (`scripts/run/`)
  - **Python Wrapper** (`memory_wrapper_cleanup.py`): Universal cross-platform solution (recommended)
  - **Bash Wrapper** (`memory_wrapper_cleanup.sh`): Native macOS/Linux implementation
  - **PowerShell Wrapper** (`memory_wrapper_cleanup.ps1`): Native Windows implementation
  - **Automatic Orphan Detection**: Identifies orphaned MCP memory processes when Claude Desktop/Code crashes
    - Unix: Detects processes adopted by init/launchd (ppid == 1)
    - Windows: Detects processes whose parent no longer exists
  - **Database Lock Prevention**: Cleans up orphaned processes before starting new server instance
  - **Safe Cleanup**: Only terminates actual orphans, preserves active sessions
  - **Comprehensive Documentation** (`README_CLEANUP_WRAPPER.md`): Installation guide, troubleshooting, and technical details
  - **Fixes**: SQLite "database is locked" errors when running multiple Claude instances after crashes

## [8.73.0] - 2026-01-09

### Added
- **Universal Permission Request Hook v1.0** (`claude-hooks/core/permission-request.js`)
  - **Automatic MCP Tool Permission Management**: Eliminates repetitive permission prompts for safe operations
  - **Safe-by-Default Design**: Auto-approves read-only operations (get, list, retrieve, search, query, etc.)
  - **Destructive Operation Protection**: Requires confirmation for write/delete operations (delete, update, execute, etc.)
  - **Universal MCP Server Support**: Works across all MCP servers (memory, browser, context7, playwright, etc.)
  - **Zero Configuration**: Works out of the box with sensible defaults
  - **Extensible Pattern Matching**: Configure custom patterns via `claude-hooks/config.json`
  - **Comprehensive Documentation**: Installation guide, configuration reference, and troubleshooting
  - **Installer Integration**: Added to core hooks installation via `install_hooks.py`
- **Sync Status Maintenance Script** (`scripts/maintenance/sync_status.py`)
  - Compares local SQLite database with Cloudflare D1
  - Shows memory counts (total, active, tombstones) for both databases
  - Identifies sync discrepancies: local-only, D1-only, pending deletions
  - Cross-platform support (Windows, macOS, Linux)
  - Handles schema differences gracefully

### Fixed
- **Cloudflare D1 Schema Missing Columns** (`src/mcp_memory_service/storage/cloudflare.py`)
  - **Problem**: D1 schema was missing `deleted_at` and `tags` columns, causing soft-delete operations to fail silently
  - **Impact**: Tombstone-based sync between devices was broken - deleted memories on one device were not synced to others
  - **Fix**: Added `deleted_at REAL DEFAULT NULL` and `tags TEXT` columns to D1 schema
  - **Index**: Added `idx_memories_deleted_at` index for query performance

## [8.72.0] - 2026-01-08

### Added
- **Graph Traversal MCP Tools** (PR #332)
  - **Feature**: Three new MCP tools for querying memory association graph directly
  - **Tools**:
    - `find_connected_memories` - Multi-hop connection discovery (5ms, 30x faster than tag search)
    - `find_shortest_path` - BFS pathfinding between two memories (15ms)
    - `get_memory_subgraph` - Subgraph extraction for visualization (25ms)
  - **Implementation**:
    - New handler module: `src/mcp_memory_service/server/handlers/graph.py` (380 lines)
    - Integration: `server_impl.py` tool registration and routing (134 lines)
    - Graceful fallback if `memory_graph` table unavailable
  - **Testing**: 10 comprehensive tests with 100% handler coverage (`tests/test_graph_traversal.py`, 328 lines, 58 assertions)
  - **Validation**: `scripts/validation/validate_graph_tools.py` for MCP schema and query correctness
  - **Quality Metrics**:
    - Health Score: 85/100 (EXCELLENT)
    - Complexity: Average 4.5 (Grade A)
    - Security: 0 vulnerabilities
  - **Benefits**:
    - 30x performance improvement over tag-based connected memory search
    - Enables Claude Code to traverse memory associations directly via MCP
    - Supports exploration of knowledge relationships and context chains

## [8.71.0] - 2026-01-06

### Added
- **Memory Management APIs and Graceful Shutdown** (PR #331)
  - **Problem**: Orphaned MCP sessions consuming excessive memory (reported in Discussion #331)
  - **Cache Cleanup Functions** (`src/mcp_memory_service/services/cache_manager.py`):
    - `clear_all_caches()` - Clear storage and service caches
    - `get_memory_usage()` - Get process memory statistics (RSS, VMS, available memory)
    - `get_cache_stats()` - Get cache hit/miss statistics
  - **Model Cache Cleanup** (`src/mcp_memory_service/storage/sqlite_vec.py`):
    - `clear_model_caches()` - Clear embedding model caches
    - `get_model_cache_stats()` - Get model cache statistics
  - **Graceful Shutdown** (`src/mcp_memory_service/server/server_impl.py`):
    - `_cleanup_on_shutdown()` - Cleanup function for signal handlers
    - Updated `shutdown()` method with proper cache and connection cleanup
    - Added `atexit` handler for normal process exit
    - SIGTERM and SIGINT handlers now call cleanup before exit
  - **Memory Management API Endpoints** (`src/mcp_memory_service/api/routes/health.py`):
    - `GET /api/memory-stats` - Get detailed memory usage (process memory + cache stats + model cache stats)
    - `POST /api/clear-caches` - Clear all caches manually (returns memory freed)
  - **Documentation**:
    - New file: `docs/troubleshooting/memory-management.md` - Comprehensive guide for monitoring and managing memory
  - **Benefits**:
    - Prevents memory leaks from orphaned sessions
    - Enables proactive memory monitoring and cleanup
    - Graceful resource release on server shutdown
    - Production-ready memory management for long-running deployments

## [8.70.0] - 2026-01-05

### Added
- **User Override Commands for Memory Hooks** (`~/.claude/hooks/utilities/user-override-detector.js`)
  - **Feature**: New `#skip` and `#remember` commands give users manual control over automatic memory triggers
  - **Implementation**:
    - Shared detection module for consistent behavior across all hooks
    - `#skip` - Bypasses memory retrieval in session-start hook
    - `#remember` - Forces mid-conversation analysis (bypasses cooldown) or session-end consolidation (bypasses thresholds)
    - Applied to: `session-start.js`, `mid-conversation.js`, `session-end.js`
  - **Configuration**: New `applyTo` array in `config.json` defines which hooks are active
  - **Documentation**: Updated `README.md` with "User Overrides" section and `README-AUTO-CAPTURE.md` with comprehensive supported hooks table
  - **Use Cases**:
    - Skip retrieval when starting fresh conversation (`#skip`)
    - Force memory capture of important mid-session insights (`#remember`)
    - Override 100-character threshold for critical session notes (`#remember`)

### Added (from v8.69.1-dev)
- **Automatic Test Memory Cleanup System** (`tests/conftest.py`, `tests/api/test_operations.py`)
  - **Problem**: Test memories polluted production database (106+ orphaned test memories found)
  - **Solution**: Tag-based cleanup system
    - Reserved `__test__` tag for all test-created memories
    - New `test_store` fixture auto-tags memories for cleanup
    - `pytest_sessionfinish` hook automatically deletes tagged memories at end of test session
    - New `delete_by_tag()` function in Code Execution API
  - **Result**: 92 test memories automatically cleaned after test run
  - **Migration**: Tests using `store()` should migrate to `test_store()` fixture

### Fixed (from v8.69.1-dev)
- **PowerShell Update Script Git Stderr Handling** (`update_and_restart.ps1`)
  - **Problem**: Script failed with `NativeCommandError` during `git pull --rebase`
  - **Root Cause**: Git writes informational messages to stderr even on success (e.g., "From github.com:..."), and `$ErrorActionPreference = "Stop"` treats any stderr as error
  - **Solution**: Temporarily set `ErrorActionPreference = "Continue"` during git pull, then check `$LASTEXITCODE` for actual errors

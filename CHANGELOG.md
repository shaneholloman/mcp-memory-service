    - Response time (SQLite-vec): ~500ms → ~50ms (10x improvement)
    - Response time (Cloudflare): ~2-3s → ~200ms (10-15x improvement)
  - **Scalability**: Now handles databases with >10,000 memories efficiently
  - **Benefits**: Pushes filtering to database WHERE clauses, leverages indexes on `created_at`

## [8.38.1] - 2025-11-26

### Fixed
- **HTTP MCP Transport: JSON-RPC 2.0 Compliance** - Fixed critical bug where HTTP MCP responses violated JSON-RPC 2.0 specification (PR #249, fixes #236)
  - **Problem**: FastAPI ignored Pydantic's `ConfigDict(exclude_none=True)` when directly returning models, causing responses to include null fields (`"error": null` in success, `"result": null` in errors)
  - **Impact**: Claude Code/Desktop rejected all HTTP MCP communications due to spec violation
  - **Solution**: Wrapped all `MCPResponse` returns in `JSONResponse` with explicit `.model_dump(exclude_none=True)` serialization
  - **Verification**:
    - Success responses now contain ONLY: `jsonrpc`, `id`, `result`
    - Error responses now contain ONLY: `jsonrpc`, `id`, `error`
  - **Testing**: Validated with curl commands against all 5 MCP endpoint response paths
  - **Credits**: @timkjr (Tim Knauff) for identifying root cause and implementing proper fix

## [8.30.0] - 2025-11-23

### Added
- **Adaptive Chart Granularity** - Analytics charts now use semantically appropriate time intervals for better trend visualization
  - **Last Month view**: Changed from 3-day intervals to weekly aggregation for clearer monthly trends
  - **Last Year view**: Uses monthly aggregation for annual overview
  - **Human-readable labels**: Charts display clear interval formatting:
    - Daily view: "Nov 15" format
    - Weekly aggregation: "Week of Nov 15" format
    - Monthly aggregation: "November 2024" format
  - **Improved UX**: Better semantic alignment between time period and chart granularity
  - **Files Modified**: `src/mcp_memory_service/web/api/analytics.py` (lines 307-345), `src/mcp_memory_service/web/static/app.js` (line 3661)

### Fixed
- **CRITICAL: Interval Aggregation Bug** - Multi-day intervals (weekly, monthly) now correctly aggregate across entire period
  - **Problem**: Intervals were only counting memories from the first day of the interval, not the entire period
  - **Impact**: Analytics showed wildly inaccurate data (e.g., 0 memories instead of 427 for Oct 24-30 week)
  - **Root Cause**: `strftime` format in date grouping only used the first timestamp, not the interval's date range
  - **Solution**: Updated aggregation logic to properly filter and count all memories within each interval
  - **Files Modified**: `src/mcp_memory_service/web/api/analytics.py` (lines 242-267)

- **CRITICAL: Data Sampling Bug** - Analytics now fetch complete historical data with proper date range filtering
  - **Problem**: API only fetched 1,000 most recent memories, missing historical data for longer time periods
  - **Impact**: Charts showed incomplete or missing data for older time ranges
  - **Solution**: Increased fetch limit to 10,000 memories with proper `created_at >= start_date` filtering
  - **Files Modified**: `src/mcp_memory_service/web/api/analytics.py` (lines 56-62)
  - **Performance**: Maintains fast response times (<200ms) even with larger dataset

### Changed
- **Analytics API**: Improved data fetching with larger limits and proper date filtering for accurate historical analysis

## [8.29.0] - 2025-11-23

### Added

  - **Clean layout**: Removed redundant sync status bar between header and body, moved to sidebar widget
  - **Backend-aware**: Widget automatically hides for sqlite-vec only users (hybrid-specific feature)
  - **API endpoints**:
    - `POST /api/sync/pause` - Pause background sync
    - `POST /api/sync/resume` - Resume background sync
  - **Hybrid backend methods**: Added `pause_sync()` and `resume_sync()` for sync control

- **Automatic Scheduled Backup System** - Enterprise-grade backup with retention policies and scheduling (#234, fixes #233)
  - **New backup module**: `src/mcp_memory_service/backup/` with `BackupService` and `BackupScheduler`
  - **SQLite native backup API**: Uses safe `sqlite3.backup()` to prevent corruption (no file copying)
  - **Async I/O**: Non-blocking backup operations with `asyncio.to_thread`
  - **Flexible scheduling**: Hourly, daily, or weekly automatic backups
  - **Retention policies**: Configurable by days and max backup count
  - **Dashboard widget**: Backup status, last backup time, manual trigger, backup count, next scheduled time
  - **Configuration via environment variables**:
    - `MCP_BACKUP_ENABLED=true` (default: true)
    - `MCP_BACKUP_INTERVAL=daily` (hourly/daily/weekly, default: daily)
    - `MCP_BACKUP_RETENTION=7` (days, default: 7)
    - `MCP_BACKUP_MAX_COUNT=10` (max backups, default: 10)
  - **API endpoints**:
    - `GET /api/backup/status` - Get backup status and scheduler info
    - `POST /api/backup/now` - Trigger manual backup
    - `GET /api/backup/list` - List available backups with metadata

## [8.28.1] - 2025-11-22

### Fixed
- **CRITICAL: HTTP MCP Transport JSON-RPC 2.0 Compliance** - Fixed protocol violation causing Claude Code rejection (#236)
  - **Problem**: HTTP MCP server returned `"error": null` in successful responses, violating JSON-RPC 2.0 spec which requires successful responses to OMIT the error field entirely (not include it as null)
  - **Impact**: Claude Code's strict schema validation rejected all HTTP MCP responses with "Unrecognized key(s) in object: 'error'" errors, making HTTP transport completely unusable
  - **Root Cause**: MCPResponse Pydantic model included both `result` and `error` fields in all responses, serializing null values
  - **Solution**:
    - Added `ConfigDict(exclude_none=True)` to MCPResponse model to exclude null fields from serialization
    - Updated docstring to document JSON-RPC 2.0 compliance requirements
    - Replaced deprecated `.dict()` with `.model_dump()` for Pydantic V2 compatibility
    - Moved json import to top of file per PEP 8 style guidelines
  - **Files Modified**:
    - `src/mcp_memory_service/web/api/mcp.py` - Added ConfigDict, updated serialization
  - **Affected Users**: All users attempting to use HTTP MCP transport with Claude Code or other strict JSON-RPC 2.0 clients
  - **Testing**: Verified successful responses exclude `error` field and error responses exclude `result` field
  - **Credits**: Thanks to @timkjr for identifying the issue and providing the fix

## [8.28.0] - 2025-11-21

### Added
- **Cloudflare Tag Filtering** - AND/OR operations for tag searches with unified API contracts (#228)
  - Added `search_by_tags(tags, operation, time_start, time_end)` to the storage base class and implemented it across SQLite, Cloudflare, Hybrid, and HTTP client backends
  - Normalized Cloudflare SQL to use `GROUP BY` + `HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT ...)` for AND semantics while supporting optional time ranges
  - Introduced `get_all_tags_with_counts()` for Cloudflare to power analytics dashboards without extra queries

### Changed
- **Tag Filtering Behavior** - `get_all_memories(tags=...)` now performs exact tag comparisons with AND logic instead of substring OR matching, and hybrid storage exposes the same `operation` parameter for parity across backends.

## [8.27.2] - 2025-11-18

### Fixed
- **Memory Type Loss During Cloudflare-to-SQLite Sync** - Fixed `memory_type` not being preserved in sync script
  - **Problem**: `scripts/sync/sync_memory_backends.py` did not extract or pass `memory_type` when syncing from Cloudflare to SQLite-vec
  - **Impact**: All memories synced via `--direction cf-to-sqlite` showed as "untyped" (100%) in dashboard analytics
  - **Root Cause**: Missing `memory_type` field in both memory dict extraction and Memory object creation
  - **Solution**:
    - Added `memory_type` to memory dictionary extraction from source
    - Added `memory_type` and `updated_at` parameters when creating Memory objects for target storage
  - **Files Modified**:
    - `scripts/sync/sync_memory_backends.py` - Added memory_type and updated_at handling
  - **Affected Users**: Users who ran `python scripts/sync/sync_memory_backends.py --direction cf-to-sqlite`
  - **Recovery**: Re-run sync from Cloudflare to restore memory types (Cloudflare preserves original types)

## [8.27.1] - 2025-11-18

### Fixed
- **CRITICAL: Timestamp Regression Bug** - Fixed `created_at` timestamps being reset during metadata sync
  - **Problem**: Bidirectional sync and drift detection (v8.25.0-v8.27.0) incorrectly reset `created_at` timestamps to current time during metadata updates
  - **Impact**: All memories synced from Cloudflare → SQLite-vec appeared "just created", destroying historical timestamp data
  - **Root Cause**: `preserve_timestamps=False` parameter reset **both** `created_at` and `updated_at`, when it should only update `updated_at`
  - **Solution**:
    - Modified `update_memory_metadata()` to preserve `created_at` from source memory during sync
    - Hybrid storage now passes all 4 timestamp fields (`created_at`, `created_at_iso`, `updated_at`, `updated_at_iso`) during drift detection
    - Cloudflare storage updated to handle timestamps consistently with SQLite-vec
  - **Files Modified**:
    - `src/mcp_memory_service/storage/sqlite_vec.py:1389-1406` - Fixed timestamp handling logic
    - `src/mcp_memory_service/storage/hybrid.py:625-637, 935-947` - Pass source timestamps during sync
    - `src/mcp_memory_service/storage/cloudflare.py:833-864` - Consistent timestamp handling
  - **Tests Added**: `tests/test_timestamp_preservation.py` - Comprehensive test suite with 7 tests covering:
    - Timestamp preservation with `preserve_timestamps=True`
    - Regression test for `created_at` preservation without source timestamps
    - Drift detection scenario
    - Multiple sync operations
    - Initial memory storage
  - **Recovery Tools**:
    - `scripts/validation/validate_timestamp_integrity.py` - Detect timestamp anomalies
    - `scripts/maintenance/recover_timestamps_from_cloudflare.py` - Restore corrupted timestamps from Cloudflare
  - **Affected Versions**: v8.25.0 (drift detection), v8.27.0 (bidirectional sync)
  - **Affected Users**: Hybrid backend users who experienced automatic drift detection or initial sync
  - **Data Recovery**: If using hybrid backend and Cloudflare has correct timestamps, run recovery script:
    ```bash
    # Preview recovery
    python scripts/maintenance/recover_timestamps_from_cloudflare.py --dry-run

    # Apply recovery
    python scripts/maintenance/recover_timestamps_from_cloudflare.py --apply
    ```

### Changed
- **Timestamp Handling Semantics** - Clarified `preserve_timestamps` parameter behavior:
  - `preserve_timestamps=True` (default): Only updates `updated_at` to current time, preserves `created_at`
  - `preserve_timestamps=False`: Uses timestamps from `updates` dict if provided, otherwise preserves existing `created_at`
  - **Never** resets `created_at` to current time (this was the bug)

### Added
- **Timestamp Integrity Validation** - New script to detect timestamp anomalies:
  ```bash
  python scripts/validation/validate_timestamp_integrity.py
  ```
  - Checks for impossible timestamps (`created_at > updated_at`)
  - Detects suspicious timestamp clusters (bulk reset indicators)
  - Analyzes timestamp distribution for anomalies
  - Provides detailed statistics and warnings

## [8.27.0] - 2025-11-17

### Added
- **Hybrid Storage Sync Performance Optimization** - Dramatic initial sync speed improvement (3-5x faster)
  - **Performance Metrics**:
    - **Before**: ~5.5 memories/second (8 minutes for 2,619 memories)
    - **After**: ~15-30 memories/second (1.5-3 minutes for 2,619 memories)
    - **3-5x faster** initial sync from Cloudflare to local SQLite
  - **Optimizations**:
    - **Bulk Existence Check**: `get_all_content_hashes()` method eliminates 2,619 individual DB queries
    - **Parallel Processing**: `asyncio.gather()` with Semaphore(15) for concurrent memory processing
    - **Larger Batch Sizes**: Increased from 100 to 500 memories per Cloudflare API call (5x fewer requests)
  - **Files Modified**:
    - `src/mcp_memory_service/storage/sqlite_vec.py` - Added `get_all_content_hashes()` method (lines 1208-1227)
    - `src/mcp_memory_service/storage/hybrid.py` - Parallel sync implementation (lines 859-921)
    - `scripts/benchmarks/benchmark_hybrid_sync.py` - Performance validation script
  - **Backward Compatibility**: Zero breaking changes, transparent optimization for all sync operations
  - **Use Case**: Users with large memory databases (1000+ memories) will see significantly faster initial sync times

### Changed
- **Hybrid Initial Sync Architecture** - Refactored sync loop for better performance
  - O(1) hash lookups instead of O(n) individual queries
  - Concurrent processing with controlled parallelism (15 simultaneous operations)
  - Reduced Cloudflare API overhead with larger batches (6 API calls vs 27)
  - Maintains full drift detection and metadata synchronization capabilities

### Fixed
- **Duplicate Sync Queue Architecture** - Resolved inefficient dual-sync issue
  - **Problem**: MCP server and HTTP server each created separate HybridStorage instances with independent sync queues
  - **Impact**: Duplicate sync work, potential race conditions, memory not immediately visible across servers
  - **Solution**: New `MCP_HYBRID_SYNC_OWNER` configuration to control which process handles Cloudflare sync
  - **Configuration Options**:
    - `"http"` - HTTP server only handles sync (recommended - avoids duplicate work)
    - `"mcp"` - MCP server only handles sync
    - `"both"` - Both servers sync independently (default for backward compatibility)
  - **Files Modified**:
    - `src/mcp_memory_service/config.py` - Added `HYBRID_SYNC_OWNER` configuration (lines 424-427)
    - `src/mcp_memory_service/storage/factory.py` - Server-type aware storage creation (lines 76-110)
    - `src/mcp_memory_service/mcp_server.py` - Pass server_type="mcp" (line 143)
    - `src/mcp_memory_service/web/dependencies.py` - Pass server_type="http" (line 65)
  - **Migration Guide**:
    ```bash
    # Recommended: Set HTTP server as sync owner to eliminate duplicate sync
    export MCP_HYBRID_SYNC_OWNER=http
    ```
  - **Backward Compatibility**: Defaults to "both" (existing behavior), no breaking changes

### Performance
- **Benchmark Results** (`python scripts/benchmarks/benchmark_hybrid_sync.py`):
  - Bulk hash loading: 2,619 hashes loaded in ~100ms (vs ~13,000ms for individual queries)
  - Parallel processing: 15x concurrency reduces CPU idle time
  - Batch size optimization: 78% reduction in API calls (27 → 6 for 2,619 memories)
  - Combined speedup: 3-5x faster initial sync

    - `BackgroundSyncService._detect_and_sync_drift()` - Core drift detection logic with dry-run mode
    - `CloudflareStorage.get_memories_updated_since()` - Query memories by update timestamp
  - **Enhanced initial sync**: Now detects and syncs metadata drift for existing memories

### Fixed
- **Issue #202** - Hybrid backend now syncs metadata updates (tags, types, custom fields)
  - Previous behavior only detected missing memories, ignoring metadata changes
  - Prevented silent data loss when memories updated on one backend but not synced
  - Tag fixes in Cloudflare now properly propagate to local SQLite
  - Metadata updates no longer diverge between backends

### Changed
- Initial sync (`_perform_initial_sync`) now compares timestamps for existing memories
- Periodic sync includes drift detection checks at configurable intervals
- Sync statistics tracking expanded with drift detection metrics

### Technical Details
- **Files Modified**:
  - `src/mcp_memory_service/config.py` - Added 3 configuration variables
  - `src/mcp_memory_service/storage/hybrid.py` - Drift detection implementation (~150 lines)
  - `src/mcp_memory_service/storage/cloudflare.py` - Added `get_memories_updated_since()` method
  - `scripts/sync/check_drift.py` - New dry-run validation script
- **Architecture**: Timestamp-based drift detection with 1-second clock skew tolerance
- **Performance**: Non-blocking async operations, configurable batch sizes
- **Safety**: Opt-in feature, dry-run mode, comprehensive audit logging

### Technical Details
- **Files Modified**: `src/mcp_memory_service/web/api/documents.py`, `src/mcp_memory_service/web/static/app.js`, `src/mcp_memory_service/web/static/index.html`
- **Code Quality**: Regex-based sanitization more scalable, DOM element caching reduces redundant queries
- **Commit**: ffc6246 - refactor: code quality improvements from Gemini review (issue #180)

## [8.24.3] - 2025-11-15

### Fixed
- **GitHub Release Manager Agent** - Resolved systematic version history omission in README.md (commit ccf959a)
  - Fixed agent behavior that was omitting previous versions from "Previous Releases" section
  - Added v8.24.1 to Previous Releases list (was missing despite being valid release)
  - Enhanced agent instructions with CRITICAL section for maintaining version history integrity
  - Added quality assurance checklist item to prevent future omissions
  - Root cause: Agent was replacing entire Previous Releases section instead of prepending new version

### Added
- **Test Coverage for Tag+Time Filtering** - Comprehensive test suite for issue #216 (commit ebff282)
  - 10 unit tests passing across SQLite-vec, Cloudflare, and Hybrid backends
  - Validates PR #215 functionality (tag+time filtering to fix semantic over-filtering bug #214)
  - Tests verify memories can be retrieved using both tag criteria AND time range filters
  - API integration tests created (with known threading issues documented for future fix)
  - Ensures regression prevention for semantic search over-filtering bug

### Changed
- GitHub release workflow now more reliable with enhanced agent guardrails
- Test suite provides better coverage for multi-filter memory retrieval scenarios

### Technical Details
- **Files Modified**:
  - `.claude/agents/github-release-manager.md` - Added CRITICAL section for Previous Releases maintenance
  - `tests/test_time_filtering.py` - 10 new unit tests for tag+time filtering
  - `tests/integration/test_api_time_search.py` - API integration tests (threading issues documented)
- **Test Execution**: All 10 unit tests passing, API tests have known threading limitations
- **Impact**: Prevents version history loss in future releases, ensures tag+time filtering remains functional

## [8.24.2] - 2025-11-15

### Fixed
- **CI/CD Workflow Infrastructure** - Development Setup Validation workflow fixes (issue #217 related)
  - Fixed bash errexit handling in workflow tests - prevents premature exit on intentional test failures
  - Corrected exit code capture using EXIT_CODE=0 and || EXIT_CODE=$? pattern
  - All 5 workflow tests now passing: version consistency, pre-commit hooks, server warnings, developer prompts, docs accuracy
  - Root cause: bash runs with -e flag (errexit), which exits immediately when commands return non-zero exit codes
  - Tests intentionally run check_dev_setup.py expecting exit code 1, but bash was exiting before capture
  - Commits: b4f9a5a, d1bcd67

### Changed
- Workflow tests can now properly validate that the development setup validator correctly detects problems
- Exit code capture no longer uses "|| true" pattern (was making all commands return 0)

### Technical Details
- **Files Modified**: .github/workflows/dev-setup-validation.yml
- **Pattern Change**:
  - Before: `python script.py || true` (always returns 0, breaks exit code testing)
  - After: `EXIT_CODE=0; python script.py || EXIT_CODE=$?` (captures actual exit code, prevents bash exit)
- **Test Jobs**: All 5 jobs in dev-setup-validation workflow now pass consistently
- **Context**: Part of test infrastructure improvement efforts (issue #217)

## [8.24.1] - 2025-11-15

### Fixed
- **Test Infrastructure Failures** - Resolved 27 pre-existing test failures (issue #217)
  - Fixed async fixture incompatibility in 6 test files (19+ failures)
  - Corrected missing imports (MCPMemoryServer → MemoryServer, removed MemoryMetadata)
  - Added missing content_hash parameter to Memory() instantiations
  - Updated hardcoded version strings (6.3.0 → 8.24.0)
  - Improved test pass rate from 63% to 71% (412/584 tests passing)
  - Execution: Automated via amp-bridge agent

### Changed
- Test suite now has cleaner baseline for detecting new regressions
- All async test fixtures now use @pytest_asyncio.fixture decorator

### Technical Details
- **Automated Fix**: Used amp-bridge agent for pattern-based refactoring
- **Execution Time**: ~15 minutes (vs 1-2 hours manual)
- **Files Modified**: 11 test files across tests/ and tests/integration/
- **Root Causes**: Test infrastructure issues, not code bugs
- **Remaining Failures**: 172 failures remain (backend config, performance, actual bugs)

- **For Existing Users**: No action required - git-based installation continues to work
- **For Contributors**: Tag creation now triggers PyPI publishing automatically

## [8.23.1] - 2025-11-10

### Fixed
- **Stale Virtual Environment Prevention System** - Comprehensive 6-layer strategy to prevent "stale venv vs source code" version mismatches
  - **Root Cause**: MCP servers load from site-packages, not source files. System restart doesn't help - it relaunches with same stale package
  - **Impact**: Prevented issue that caused v8.23.0 tag validation bug to persist despite v8.22.2 fix (source showed v8.23.0 while venv had v8.5.3)

### Added
- **Phase 1: Automated Detection**
  - New `scripts/validation/check_dev_setup.py` - Validates source/venv version consistency, detects editable installs
  - Enhanced `scripts/hooks/pre-commit` - Blocks commits when venv is stale, provides actionable error messages
  - Added CLAUDE.md development setup section with explicit `pip install -e .` guidance

- **Phase 2: Runtime Warnings**
  - Added `check_version_consistency()` function in `src/mcp_memory_service/server.py`

  - Enhanced `docs/development/ai-agent-instructions.md` with proper setup commands

- **Phase 3: Interactive Onboarding**
  - Enhanced `scripts/installation/install.py` with developer detection (checks for git repo)
  - Interactive prompt guides developers to use `pip install -e .` for editable installs
  - New CI/CD workflow `.github/workflows/dev-setup-validation.yml` with 5 comprehensive test jobs:
    1. Version consistency validation
    2. Pre-commit hook functionality
    3. Server startup warnings
    4. Interactive developer prompts
    5. Documentation accuracy checks

### Changed
- **Developer Workflow**: Developers now automatically guided to use `pip install -e .` for proper setup
- **Pre-commit Hook**: Now validates venv consistency before allowing commits
- **Installation Process**: Detects developer mode and provides targeted guidance

### Technical Details
- **6-Layer Prevention System**:
  1. **Development**: Pre-commit hook blocks bad commits, detection script validates setup
  2. **Runtime**: Server startup warnings catch edge cases
  3. **Documentation**: CLAUDE.md, README.md, ai-agent-instructions.md all updated
  4. **Automation**: check_dev_setup.py, pre-commit hook, CI/CD workflow
  5. **Interactive**: install.py prompts developers for editable install
  6. **Testing**: CI/CD workflow with 5 comprehensive test jobs

- **Files Modified**:
  - `scripts/validation/check_dev_setup.py` - NEW automated detection script
  - `scripts/hooks/pre-commit` - Enhanced with venv validation

### 🔧 **Dashboard Statistics Fix**

#### Bug Fixes
- **🎯 Backend-Agnostic Dashboard Stats** - Fixed `dashboard_get_stats` to use configured storage backend instead of hardcoded ChromaDB
  - ❌ **Previous Issue**: Dashboard always showed ChromaDB stats (often 0 memories) regardless of actual backend
  - ✅ **Fixed**: Now properly detects and uses SQLite-vec, Cloudflare, or ChromaDB based on configuration
  - ✅ **Consistency**: Uses same pattern as `handle_check_database_health` for reliable backend detection
  - ✅ **Accuracy**: Dashboard now shows correct memory counts and backend information

#### Technical Improvements
- **Backend Detection**: Dynamic storage type detection via `storage.__class__.__name__`
- **Error Handling**: Proper async/await handling and graceful error reporting
- **Code Consistency**: Unified approach with existing health check functionality

# Claude Code Integration: Commands vs MCP Server

This guide helps you choose the best integration method for your workflow and needs.

## TL;DR - Quick Decision

### Choose **Commands** if you want:
✅ **Immediate setup** (2 minutes to working)  
✅ **Simple usage** (`claude /memory-store "content"`)  
✅ **No configuration** (zero MCP server setup)  
✅ **Context awareness** (automatic project detection)  

### Choose **MCP Server** if you want:
✅ **Deep integration** with Claude Code's MCP system  
✅ **Multi-server workflows** (alongside other MCP servers)  
✅ **Maximum flexibility** and configuration control  
✅ **Traditional MCP tool** interactions

## Use Case Recommendations

### Perfect for Commands

#### **Individual Developers**
- Working on personal projects
- Want immediate memory capabilities
- Prefer direct command interfaces
- Don't need complex MCP workflows

#### **Quick Prototyping**
- Testing memory service capabilities
- Short-term project memory needs
- Learning the memory service features
- Demo and presentation scenarios

#### **Context-Heavy Work**
- Projects requiring automatic context detection
- Git repository-aware memory operations
- Session-based development workflows
- Frequent project switching

### Perfect for MCP Server

#### **Teams & Organizations**
- Multiple developers sharing memory service
- Complex multi-server MCP workflows
- Integration with other MCP tools
- Standardized development environments

#### **Power Users**
- Advanced MCP server configurations
- Custom tool integrations
- Complex memory service setups
- Maximum flexibility requirements

#### **Production Deployments**
- Server-based memory service hosting
- Multi-client concurrent access
- Enterprise security requirements
- Scalable memory operations

---

## Migration & Compatibility

### Can I Use Both?
✅ **Yes!** Commands and MCP Server can coexist:
- Commands for quick operations
- MCP Server for deep integration
- Switch between methods as needed
- No conflicts or data issues

### Switching Between Methods

#### From Commands to MCP Server
```bash
# Your existing memories remain intact
# Just add MCP server registration
claude mcp add memory-service spawn -- /path/to/memory/command
```

#### From MCP Server to Commands
```bash
# Install commands alongside existing setup
python install.py --install-claude-commands
```

### Data Compatibility
🟢 **Full Compatibility**: Both methods use the same underlying memory service and database. Memories stored via commands are accessible via MCP server and vice versa.

## Real-World Examples

### Commands Workflow
```bash
# Start development session
claude /memory-context --summary "Starting OAuth integration work"

# Store decisions as you work
claude /memory-store --tags "oauth,security" "Using Auth0 for OAuth provider"

# Later, recall what you decided
claude /memory-recall "what did we decide about OAuth last week?"

# Check everything is working
claude /memory-health
```

### MCP Server Workflow
```bash
# Start Claude Code session
claude

# In conversation with Claude:
"Please store this OAuth integration decision in memory with tags oauth and security"
"What did we decide about authentication last week?"
"Show me all memories related to security decisions"
```

## Making Your Choice

### Start with Commands if:
- 🟢 You want to try the memory service quickly
- 🟢 You're working on individual projects
- 🟢 You prefer direct command interfaces
- 🟢 You want automatic context detection

### Choose MCP Server if:
- 🟢 You're already using other MCP servers

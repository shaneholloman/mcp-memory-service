# MCP Memory Service - Development Roadmap

## Project Status

**Current Version**: v8.38.1
**Architecture**: Dual-Service (MCP + HTTP Dashboard with Code Execution API)
**Status**: Production-ready with PyPI distribution, OAuth, and 24 MCP tools

## ✅ Completed Milestones (v8.0-v8.38)

### 1. Claude Code Compatibility Resolution
- **Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED** - Claude Code compatibility achieved via Code Execution API (v8.19.0+)
- **Tasks**:
  - [x] ~~Deep dive into Claude Code's SSE client implementation~~ - Bypassed via Code Execution API
  - [x] ~~Develop compatibility layer for header requirements~~ - Not needed with new architecture
  - [x] ~~Test with Claude Code development builds~~ - Code Execution API works universally
  - [x] ~~Create custom SSE endpoint if needed~~ - Code Execution API eliminates need

### 2. Documentation Enhancement
- **Status**: ✅ **LARGELY COMPLETED** (docs/ directory has 26 subdirectories)
- **Tasks**:
  - [x] Expand client compatibility matrix - Documented in README (13+ clients)
  - [ ] Create video deployment tutorials - Still needed
  - [x] Document performance benchmarks - Code Execution API benchmarks in CHANGELOG
  - [x] Add troubleshooting guides - docs/troubleshooting/ directory exists

### 3. Tool Implementation Completion
- **Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED** - 24 MCP tools implemented in server.py
- **Tasks**:
  - [x] Add remaining 17 memory operations to FastMCP server - All core operations complete
  - [x] Implement advanced search and filtering - Tag, time, semantic search complete
  - [x] Add batch operations for bulk memory management - Batch delete, consolidation complete
  - [x] Create memory import/export tools - Document ingestion (PDF/DOCX/CSV/JSON) complete

## 🎯 Current Focus (v8.39-v9.0 - Q1 2026)

### Recent Achievements (v8.30-v8.38)
- **v8.38.1** - HTTP MCP JSON-RPC 2.0 compliance fix (Claude Code/Desktop compatibility)
- **v8.38.0** - Phase 2b code quality: ~176 lines duplicate code eliminated, 5.5% → 4.5% duplication
- **v8.37.0** - Phase 2a code quality: 5 duplicate high-complexity functions eliminated
- **v8.32.0** - pyscn static analysis integration for multi-layer QA workflow
- **v8.31.0** - Revolutionary batch update performance (21,428x faster consolidation)
- **v8.30.0** - Analytics intelligence with adaptive charts and accurate trend visualization

### Active Development Priorities
- **Code Quality Target**: <3% duplication (currently 4.5%)
- **Test Coverage Target**: 95%+ (currently ~88%)
- **Complexity Reduction**: Continue Phase 2 refactoring (complexity >7 functions)
- **Documentation**: Video tutorials, enhanced troubleshooting guides

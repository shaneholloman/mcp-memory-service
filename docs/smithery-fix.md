# Smithery Installation Fix

This document describes the fix for Issue #6 - First Run Issues using Smithery.

## Problem

Users experienced connection timeouts and WebSocket failures when installing the MCP Memory Service via Smithery. The root cause was an incorrect configuration in `smithery.yaml` that pointed to the wrong execution method.

## Solution

### Updated Smithery Configuration

The `smithery.yaml` file has been updated to use the proper Python module execution:

```yaml
commandFunction:
  |-
  (config) => ({ 
    command: 'python', 
    args: ['-m', 'mcp_memory_service.server'], 
    env: { 
      MCP_MEMORY_CHROMA_PATH: config.chromaDbPath, 
      MCP_MEMORY_BACKUPS_PATH: config.backupsPath,
      PYTHONUNBUFFERED: '1',
      PYTORCH_ENABLE_MPS_FALLBACK: '1'
    } 
  })
```

### Key Changes

1. **Execution Method**: Changed from direct script execution to Python module execution (`-m mcp_memory_service.server`)
2. **Environment Variables**: Added proper environment variables for cross-platform compatibility
3. **Version Support**: Added `--version` flag support in the server for better debugging

### Additional Files

1. **smithery_wrapper.py**: A Smithery-specific wrapper that handles dependency checking and fallback execution
2. **test_smithery.py**: A test script to verify the Smithery configuration works correctly

## Testing

To verify the fix works:

1. **With Dependencies Installed**:
   ```bash
   # Install required packages
   pip install mcp chromadb sentence-transformers
   
   # Test the configuration
   python test_smithery.py
   ```

2. **Version Check**:
   ```bash
   python -m mcp_memory_service.server --version
   ```

3. **Manual Smithery Test**:
   ```bash
   # Set environment variables
   export MCP_MEMORY_CHROMA_PATH="/tmp/test_chroma"
   export MCP_MEMORY_BACKUPS_PATH="/tmp/test_backups"
   
   # Run the command that Smithery would execute
   python -m mcp_memory_service.server
   ```

## Deployment

After this fix, Smithery installations should work properly by:

1. Installing the package and its dependencies
2. Executing the service using the proper Python module method
3. Providing appropriate environment configuration

## Verification

The fix resolves the following issues:
- ✅ WebSocket connection failures
- ✅ Connection timeout errors
- ✅ Improper module loading
- ✅ Missing environment variables
- ✅ Version information support

## Future Considerations

For even better Smithery integration, consider:
1. Publishing the package to PyPI for easier dependency management
2. Creating a conda package for alternative installation
3. Adding health check endpoints for better monitoring
